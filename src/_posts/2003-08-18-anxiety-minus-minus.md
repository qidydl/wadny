Well, thanks to the power outage, the traffic to Mosport was incredibly light, so we actually managed to get there at a reasonable hour. The weekend wasn’t that bad, I might add more on it later. Unfortunately, the RIT server is still down so EdgeIRC is still missing a server. My laptop warranty has been renewed, and it’s packed up, ready to send back for repairs. My desktop is still in an unknown state, I’m running a backup on it right now and hopefully Alienware will fix it, assuming it’s actually still broken.

Sanity has returned.
