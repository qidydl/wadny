title: February 27, 1999 - Ridge Hall help center
---
<p>This is a conversation between a computer assistant and some stupid idiot. </p>
<p>"Ridge Hall computer assistant, may I help you?"
<br>"Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."
<br>"What sort of trouble?"
<br>"Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away." 
<br>"Went away?"
<br>"They disappeared."
<br>"Hmm. What does your screen look like now?"
<br>"Nothing."
<br>"Nothing?"
<br>"It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."
<br>"Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"
<br>"How do I tell?"
<br>"Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?"
<br>"What's a sea-prompt?"
<br>"Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?"
<br>"There isn't any cursor. I told you, it won't accept anything I type."
<br>"Does your monitor have a power indicator?"
<br>"What's a monitor?"
<br>"It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?"
<br>"I don't know."
<br>"Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?"
<br>"Yes, I think so."
<br>"Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall."
<br>"...Yes, it is."
<br>"When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?"
<br>"No."
<br>"Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable."
<br>"...Okay, here it is."
<br>"Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer."
<br>"I can't reach."
<br>"Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?"
<br>"No."
<br>"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"
<br>"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle - it's because it's dark."
<br>"Dark?"
<br>"Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window."
<br>"Well, turn the office light on then."
<br>"I can't."
<br>"No? Why not?"
<br>"Because there's a power outage."
<br>"A power... a power outage? Aha, okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?"
<br>"Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."
<br>"Good. Go get them, unplug your system, and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."
<br>"Really? Is it that bad?"
<br>"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
<br>"Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"
<br>"Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer."
