title: Redesign number four million and two
---
<p>Well, at least it feels like that. Yes, I’ve gone and done it again, redesigning the entire site. This time I did a
    little more planning though. The fixed-width design is based on articles like <a
        href="http://www.notestips.com/80256B3A007F2692/1/TAIO-5TT34F" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - notestips.com article on fixed-width design">this one</a> that promote the
    benefits of having a fixed line width, such as increased ease of reading. It seems to work just fine, so I think
    I’ll keep it. Also, The Yellow™ is back after an extended hiatus. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Internet Archive</a>, I was able to recover the exact color I used
    before.</p>
<p>Some important but less-obvious stuff: ALL menus are now in the sidebar, under “Main menu”. This includes submenus
    for the About, Band, and Programming sections, and also the menus for the News page. You may have also noticed that
    news posts now (finally!) have titles. All of the old news posts need to have titles set; until then, the news
    system will automatically substitute the date and time of the post for its title. NONE of the archives work—sorry. I
    still need to write all of that. The calendar and quicklinks are also static placeholders at the moment, and
    recommended links needs to be filled out. There’s also a bunch of other new stuff I need to add, including some
    really neat features I’ve come up with. You’ll just have to wait and see…</p>
