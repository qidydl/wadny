title: Dear God, I’m Old

One of the ladies who works here brought her daughter in to work today, and she’s talking on a <em>cell phone</em>.  She’s maybe 4, and she’s talking on a <em>bloody cell phone</em>.  Goshdarnit, when I was a kid, all we had were phones with cords and they were tethered to the wall and our cars didn’t even have air conditioning and the TV had maybe a dozen channels and we didn’t have none of this high-falutin’ <em>In-tar-net</em>… sigh.
