title: Best Practices
---
<p>Warning: this is a big, long article, possibly the longest I’ve yet written. I also think it goes over some issues
    that are very important to the web design and development community, and I hope you’ll take the time to read it
    through.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>There seems to be a recent flurry of activity around the website development community. The first item is <a
        href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/06/11/bestPractice" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Simon Willison: Embracing Best Practice">Simon suggesting</a> that we adopt the
    term “best practice” when dealing with web development. I agree with him that we need to be thinking in broader
    terms, not just about validation or semantic-ness, but about usability and user interaction and client satisfaction.
    As a software engineer, I can look around my industry and see what the web development community may look like in a
    decade or two, and moving to the concept of best practices is an important one—although software engineers are still
    debating what, exactly, a best practice is. Web development needs to move from lower-level thinking, along the lines
    of fancy new CSS tricks, to higher-level thinking, dealing with the development process and website architechture,
    before the industry can mature.</p>
<h3>State of the Industry</h3>
<p>The second item is <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2004/06/16/contest.html" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Dan Cederholm’s book contest</a> that resulted in 485 links to various articles
    and websites about web development. <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com/articles/simple_list" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - OrderedList - Simple List">Steve Smith</a> and <a
        href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2004/06/21/bonanza.html" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - SimpleBits - Web Standards Link Bonanza">Dan himself</a> have compiled these
    links into lists, which may be the most comprehensive directory of web development articles out there right now.
    This is a good thing, because it clearly shows how active the web development community is, and it provides a great
    quantity of information to help developers, but there’s a problem.</p>
<p>The problem, as <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/06/17/validation_m/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - mezzoblue - Validation, Moderation, Constipation">Dave Shea realized</a>, is that
    there is very little centralization. The web development community is sort of sprawled about, and right now, the
    best way to keep track of it all is to read the weblogs of those at the forefront. This works now, but what happens
    when the industry expands? What happens if the third world leapfrogs traditional telecommunications and dives
    directly into the Internet, as some countries have already done? Someday, the number of people with Internet access
    will be measured in the billions, and web development could be a full-fledged international industry. When there are
    thousands or millions of web developers, reading everyone’s weblog isn’t going to work anymore.</p>
<h3>Looking for Guidance</h3>
<p>How can we deal with this? This is where the community must reflect and choose a solution. I have a hard time
    believing there isn’t an existing organization that can rise up to become a central institution in the web
    development community, to help set best practices and drive maturation of web development. <a
        href="http://www.w3c.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - the World Wide Web Consortium">The
        W3C</a> is a fairly obvious choice, although it requires them to expand beyond simply writing technical
    specifications to attack the problems of development process and the actual implementation and use of the standards
    they create.</p>
<h3>A Central Repository</h3>
<p>I won’t say any more about this “future of the industry” business. I’m primarily a software engineer, not a web
    developer, so it’s not really my place to say. However, I also agree with Dave that in the short term, the community
    needs some sort of a central repository for web standards and best practices; a place for articles, tutorials,
    forums, code snippets, news, and so forth. There are already a variety of sites that do some of this, such as <a
        href="http://www.alistapart.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">A List Apart</a>,
    <a href="http://www.cre8asite.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Cre8asite</a>,
    <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">CSS-Discuss</a>,
    <a href="http://www.cssvault.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">CSS Vault</a>,
    <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">CSS Zen Garden</a>,
    <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Digital Web Magazine</a>,
    <a href="http://www.evolt.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Evolt</a>,
    <a href="http://www.hiveminds.info/phpBB/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">HiveMinds</a>, and the
    <a href="http://www.wdvl.com/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Web Developer’s Virtual Library">WDVL</a>. The problem is, none of these sites
    seem to offer the complete package, none of them have very much info on server-side processing, and none of them is
    The Central Source.</p>
<h3>How to Build It?</h3>
<p>In the comments to Dave’s article, many people expressed an interest in having one site where they can go for
    everything they need, including code samples for both front-end and back-end work. Well, the only way this will work
    is if there is only one site; otherwise, the entire purpose is defeated. And we need wide, serious support from the
    big movers and shakers: Jeffery Zeldman, Doug Bowman, Dan Cederholm, Paul Scrivens, Dave Shea, Andrei Herasimchuk,
    Shaun Inman, Cameron Moll, Mark Pilgrim, Didier Hilhorst, Matt Mullenweg, Jon Hicks, and the list goes on and on.
    Without a full lineup of big names focusing their effort, I doubt any one site can become a singular source for the
    web development community.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps the community doesn’t want a single source; monopolies can be dangerous, after all. But then, how many
    sources should there be? 2? 3? 5? 10? A dozen? A hundred? I do have some discomfort about the idea, but web
    development needs a unified voice, and that is tough to accomplish when the community is fractured among different
    sites. Of course, to create a site like this requires organization; and the ideal organization would be a website
    like this, so we wind up in a Möbius strip of organizing the organization. The next best option would be to have one
    person set up temporary forums and/or a wiki to use for developing the eventual repository. I am willing to do this,
    but to simply nominate myself feels too egotistical, especially since I’ not a very big fish in the pond of web
    development.</p>
<h3>The Issues</h3>
<p>Thus, we come back to the community, which must ask itself a few questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How important is the concept of best practices and the maturity of the industry?</li>
    <li>Do we want a single website/organization to speak for and regulate the industry?</li>
    <li>If so, is there an existing organization that will fit the bill? Or do we need a new organization?</li>
    <li>Do we want a single website to be a repository of the community’s collective knowledge?</li>
    <li>If so, is there an existing website that can fill this roll? Or do we need a new one?</li>
    <li>If we need a new one, who will lead its development?</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe these are the issues that the community must reach consensus on, or risk stunting the growth of the
    industry. I have answered these questions as best I can, but I will not pretend my answers are the only ones, or
    even that “correct” answers exist. But I do believe the community needs to sort out these issues, and when it does,
    it will emerge stronger and more unified, with a clear path ahead of it.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I’m completely, utterly wrong. I leave it to the community to decide.</p>
