<p>From a book called <cite>The Nature of the Judicial Process</cite> by Benjamin Cardozo:</p>
<blockquote cite="urn:isbn:0-300-00033-2"><p>It may not be modified at once, for the attempt to do absolute justice in every single case would make the development and maintenance of general rules impossible; but if a rule continues to work injustice, it will eventually be reformulated.</p></blockquote>
<p>An interesting experiment in meme propogation, I suppose.</p>
