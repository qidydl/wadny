<p>It’s 1 in the morning, so I can’t take a picture of the actual new car.  That will have to wait for tomorrow or later.</p>

<p>My grandmother on my mother’s side has been living in a retirement home for several years now, originally with my grandfather.  He died a few years ago, and she recently decided to move into a smaller apartment and get rid of some of his old things.  We visited her on Friday for dinner and to help her with unpacking, and I found this sitting on a table.  Nobody knew she even had it.  It’s from a restaurant, but the picture is really quite nice.  The restaurant is where my mom used to work <del>way back when she was still in</del> <ins datetime="2004-06-18T22:33:00-05:00">after she graduated from</ins> college.</p>
