<p>Not a whole lot going on. Been watching some racing with my dad… just finished the <abbr
        title="Championship Auto Racing Teams">CART</abbr> Chicago race from last week and some other stuff, but I
    haven’t been spending days out of the house like I was earlier in the week. However, I did get some more work done
    on the website today. You’ll notice that navigating through the about, band, gaming, and mirc sections works
    differently now—you get a subdirectory with a real name instead of the unintelligible “something?subsec=#” crap I
    had before. I didn’t actually get any real content into the gaming section, but I’ve got most of the navigation in
    place, which is the part most likely to give me problems. Content <em>should</em> be arriving sometime soon…</p>
