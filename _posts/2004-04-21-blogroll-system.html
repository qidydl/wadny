title: Blogroll system
---
<p>So, I’ve gone and added more stuff to my news system. This time I created an <a href="/news/blogroll/feed/">automatic
        blogroll feed-generator</a>. I got the idea from <a href="http://bensinclair.com/archives/000201.php"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - BenSinclair.com: Python Power!">Ben Sinclair</a>, and built my own
    system using the core of his script with my own interface wrapped around it. Every hour, a cron job runs my version
    of Ben’s python script, which fetches all of the feeds for the sites in my blogroll, compiles all the entries
    together, crops the list down to the newest 50, compiles them together into a file, and runs tidy on that file to
    make it reasonably valid XHTML. It’s not perfect yet, but I’ll keep working on it.</p>
