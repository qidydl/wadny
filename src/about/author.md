My name is David, and this is wadny.com. I’m a software engineer in the US, with a degree in software engineering from RIT. I’ve been programming since high school (2000-ish) and working in the software field since 2007.

*[US]: United States
*[RIT]: Rochester Institute of Technology

I started out doing C++ in high school and PHP for various personal website projects, including earlier iterations of this one. In college I moved on to Java and some Python, and started learning about design using UML and Rational Rose. After graduating, it was back to C++ for five and a half years, this time on Linux. Since mid-2013, I’ve migrated into the world of web applications and cloud services on the .NET platform, with a fair amount of SQL and JavaScript mixed in. More details are in my [professional information]({% link professional.md %}).

*[UML]: Unified Modeling Language
*[SQL]: Structured Query Language

## Desktop
I used to be heavily into the desktop customizing scene on Windows for many years, going back to the days when Windows 98 was as good as it got. I used to use Litestep and several other programs to do some rather serious customization work, but nowadays I’ve moved on to Linux and also shifted my priorities more towards things being simple and reliable rather than looking exactly a certain way. It helps that the default UIs have gotten a lot better as well.

### Wallpaper
Sadly, most of the sites in the customizing scene that I used to get wallpaper from have disappeared or died off, so I’m not sure what good sources there are out there any more. Here are the small handful I know of that are still online.

- [Desktopography](https://desktopography.net/){:rel='external'}
- [EndEffect](https://www.endeffect.com/ "The artwork of George Smith"){:rel='external'}
- [Simon Stålenhag](https://www.simonstalenhag.se/ "Simon Stålenhag Art Gallery"){:rel='external'}

I only have a few wallpaper images I use currently. I did not make any of these, I claim no ownership or copyright or license for them, and I’m not sure where they all came from, although a couple are watermarked and clearly from Desktopography.
