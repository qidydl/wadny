title: Republicans are evil
---
For those of you that don’t read [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/ "Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters"){:rel='external'}, apparently some Republicans have been [breaking into Democrat computers](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/22/infiltration_of_files_seen_as_extensive/ "Boston.com: Infiltration of files seen as extensive"){:rel='external'}, stealing their files, and sending them to the media. Now, I know the entire government is made up of self-serving, Constitution-abusing criminals (and in the case of our President, people who couldn’t pass a high school English exam), but this is just ridiculous.

America has changed from the bastion of freedom and self-government into an abusive administrative state that willfully violates our most basic human rights. If people actually read the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript){:rel='external'} anymore, they would know that if government fails to protect our rights, it is not only our right but our duty to <q cite="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government</q> that does. Our government is violating our rights, and yet we do nothing. Self-government is failing, and if people continue to do nothing then it will eventually collapse.
