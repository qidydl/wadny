title: Spring is here
---
Well, spring has been here for a while now, so I decided it was time to update my header image. I couldn’t bear to colorize that sky, so I made the header and footer blue and the sidebar yellow. I may begin rotating header images more frequently, if I can find some nature around here. I also stuck some borders in the sidebar to help clearly delineate each section.

[Chris](http://dris.dyndns.org:8080/archives/675/index.html "Passive Digressive - 23rd post"){:rel='external'} told me to:

1. Go into your blog’s archives.
2. Find your 23rd post (or closest to).
3. Find the fifth sentence (or closest to).
4. Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.

My [23<sup>rd</sup> post]({% post_url 2001-07-19-still-recovering %} "Still recovering") is rather simple, so I’ll paste it in entirety:

> The old news database files are saved, but I need a way to convert them into plaintext or somehow get them into this server, so the news will be missing for a while. Sorry.
{:cite="{% post_url 2001-07-19-still-recovering %}"}

Technically, the sentence I would paste would be <q>Sorry.</q> but that seemed kind of silly.
