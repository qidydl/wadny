title: Republicans are evil
---
<p>For those of you that don’t read <a href="http://slashdot.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters">slashdot</a>, apparently some Republicans have been <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/22/infiltration_of_files_seen_as_extensive/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Boston.com: Infiltration of files seen as extensive">breaking into Democrat computers</a>, stealing their files, and sending them to the media.  Now, I know the entire government is made up of self-serving, Constitution-abusing criminals (and in the case of our President, people who couldn’t pass a high school English exam), but this is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>America has changed from the bastion of freedom and self-government into an abusive administrative state that willfully violates our most basic human rights.  If people actually read the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/declaration_transcript.html" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Declaration of Independence</a> anymore, they would know that if government fails to protect our rights, it is not only our right but our duty to <q cite="http://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/declaration_transcript.html">alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government</q> that does.  Our government is violating our rights, and yet we do nothing.  Self-government is failing, and if people continue to do nothing then it will eventually collapse.</p>
