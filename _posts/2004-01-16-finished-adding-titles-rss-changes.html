title: Finished adding titles, RSS changes
---
I just finished adding titles to the rest of the news posts, just so they all look somewhat nicer.  I also added a couple of acronym tags here and there, and marked up some changes with &lt;ins&gt; tags just to be semantic.  I also changed the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feed to include full <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> enclosed in &lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt; tags so it still validates.  Apparently <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/threads/escMarkup" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Norman Walsh considers escaped markup harmful">I’m not supposed to do that</a>, but I hear that many feed readers don’t support namespaces (a system for including different types of <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> in one document), and if I don’t escape the data then the feed is invalid, so this looks like the only choice for now.  Let me know if there are any problems.  I also made a handful of small news system changes; nothing obvious or important, really.
