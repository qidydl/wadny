Well, that was a fun weekend.  The <acronym title="Local Area Network">LAN</acronym> party on Saturday wasn’t quite what I hoped it was going to be, but it wasn’t too bad.  It took forever for anyone to show up, so I spent an hour or so watching Kevin Warner play <acronym title="Grand Theft Auto 3">GTA3</acronym> and <acronym title="Soldier of Fortune 2">SoF2</acronym>.  After people finally showed up, we did a bit of gaming but the network was all fucked up so we didn’t do as much as usual.  There was a bit of Counter-Strike, Tribes 2, and <acronym title="Grand Theft Auto 2">GTA2</acronym>, but most of the time was spent just goofing off.  It wasn’t too bad, though.  I managed to score GTA3 off someone else, although my comp can’t run it for shit.  Everything else I have runs fine, but GTA3 was stuttering and running really slow.  Oh well.  After the LAN, four of us went out for a 1am <acronym title="International House of Pancakes">IHOP</acronym> run.  Mmm, french toast… good stuff.  Got to sleep around 2 or 2:30 am.
<p>I woke up around 1pm on Sunday and staggered around for a bit before settling down to watch the Portland CART race.  Too bad Max Papis had to sit it out, Sigma really needs some funding, but I was glad to hear CART is sticking with Ford and the turbo engines.  Switching to the IRL engine formula would just waste money and lose fans.  I don’t want to give away the ending for anyone who hasn’t seen it, so I’ll just say this: wheel nuts are supposed to STAY ON.</p>
<p>I think that’s about it for my weekend; I did quite a bit of stuff but it was almost all on Saturday.  I missed all of the Le Mans coverage, but my dad taped it all so I need to watch that soon.  The Joest Audis probably won again, but I still want to see what happened.</p>
<p>Tune in tomorrow for the aftermath of my Regents Physics exam!</p>
