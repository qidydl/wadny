title: Some content additions
---
I just added a new humor article (there’s one or two others left to go), added “Blissfull” to the design section (there’s maybe 5 more of those to add), and updated my screenshot in the about section.  BTW, I’ve been actually using my webcam a bit lately.  Any requests to look at random crap should be given in #gloom on EdgeIRC (irc.edgeirc.net).  Come on, post more comments!  Discuss the article, the design, the desktop, the webcam, whatever.
