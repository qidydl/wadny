<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Rochester Institute of Technology Honors Program owns and operates a server for student use. This server provides
    many things, including a website with information for students. I was a student in the Honors Program, an
    administrator on the server, and chair of the Honors <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Committee,
    which is officially responsible for the server. We decided that the existing website needed considerable
    improvement, so I created this new design.</a>
</p>
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>Like all of my current designs, the Honors Program website is built with standards-based, semantic <abbr
        title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> for markup and <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for layout and design. This results in easier development, faster
    redesigns in the future, smaller page sizes, more control over page design, and better accessibility for all users.
    This is particularly important for an educational site, because it must be accessible to all students, including
    those with disabilities. Standards-based design gives you this with little additional effort.</p>
<h3>Visual design</h3>
<p>There was no previous website to base this design on. There is an <a href="http://www.rit.edu/~aep/honors/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">official, faculty-run website</a>, but it is not particularly
    attractive, so a new design was created from scratch. I went with a fairly minimalist approach, since it felt
    appropriate for an educational siteâ€”simple and focused, without distractions. I did carry over some of the color
    scheme from the faculty site into the student site, to give them some connection, but there was little else on the
    faculty page that fit in.</p>
<p>Also, the Honors Program website uses a fixed-width design, so that the content width never grows beyond a maximum
    width. This helps keep line widths within a readable range, so that users with high resolutions can still read the
    page easily.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Like most of my sites, the RIT Honors Program site is built on a PHP backend. This is primarily for maintenance and
    integration, since it allows Committee sites to tie into the main design with little effort. Pages are set up as
    directories, so the underlying technology is not exposed to the user and can be changed at will without impacting
    links.</p>
