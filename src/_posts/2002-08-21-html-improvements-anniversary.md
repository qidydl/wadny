title: HTML improvements, anniversary
---
Ok, some more tweaking to the site… I fixed the dashed border separating the menu from the content so it doesn’t partially disappear or get displayed twice, changed the headings (gray boxes with bold text) to real `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags, and cleaned up some of the HTML for text browsers and/or screen readers. I doubt anyone reading this site uses one of those, but if you are, the site should be easier for you to use now. Of course, that means the HTML is also cleaner and there’s less to download, so the page should load faster. Good stuff all around.

I noticed that my news posting system will be 2 years old on September 6th… I’m amazed it’s lasted that long. Hooray for me!
