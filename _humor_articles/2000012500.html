<li>You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.</li>
<li>You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.</li>
<li>The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.</li>

<li>People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.</li>
<li>If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."</li>
<li>The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy people who are not in them.</li>
<li>If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its glories, and he decides to deliver a message to humanity, he will NOT use as his messenger a person on
