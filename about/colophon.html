<p>This page contains information about wadny.com itself: a history of the website, going back before it was called
    wadny.com; information on the markup and standards followed; information on the typography used; information on
    software and programming languages used; and rights and various administrivia.</p>

<h1>Site history</h1>
<p>My first work with creating websites was duke3d.com, before I actually knew how to make websites. I recall not being
    able to do a page background because I kept spelling it “backround”. This lasted for a little while, but
    Duke Nukem 3D eventually got old. Next I moved on to the Quake 2 Information Database (QID), which went through
    numerous redesigns before I got ambitious and turned it into the First-Person Shooter Information Database (FPSID).
    Then a website called YDL was added on and redesigned twice to handle the webdesign business I pretended I had and
    the mIRC scripting stuff that I actually did have (which can still be downloaded from here but is horribly out of
    date and undocumented).</p>
<p>Then I got lucky. Out of the kindness of his heart, a friend of mine named Stal gave me free hosting with PHP, an
    <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> database, a subdomain, as much space as I wanted, and no
    transfer limit—an incredibly nice gift. I repayed him by selling him duke3d.com for $20, which was a bargain
    at the time. I started adding some personal stuff to my website, such as my wallpaper collection and some
    experimental designs, and it grew into a hacked-together front end with frames on top of two separate websites
    (FPSID and YDL). It wasn’t exactly easy to work with, and some of it was downright ugly.</p>
<p>Then I heard about the <a href="http://www.threeoh.com/may1/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">May 1st
        Reboot</a> from <a href="http://www.endeffect.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">endeffect</a>
    and decided I needed to reorganize into a single, uniform website instead of a conglomeration of several sites. I
    signed up just in time and got to work on trying to organize everything. Slowly, everything started to pull
    together, and eventually I had a decent site that worked quite well and could easily expand to cover other topics.
    It was all based on PHP so I could add or delete entire sections in a minute or so. The design, although a little
    crude, was much better than what I had before and was pretty clean.</p>
<p>Then everything fell apart. I’m still not sure why, but Stal suddenly couldn’t host my site any more, so
    I started the search for hosting. Eventually, I settled on registering the domain name with <a
        href="http://www.gandi.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Gandi</a>, hosting the <abbr
        title="Domain Name Service">DNS</abbr> with <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">DynDNS</a>, and hosting the website itself on InstantWebsiteDesign (slightly
    misleading name, since they didn’t design any part of my site). That setup worked well for a couple months
    before InstantWebsiteDesign broke their servers, replaced my page with someone else’s, and stopped responding
    to all communication. After cursing at them for a while, I moved to <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">phpwebhosting.com</a>, which has been very stable for a while now.
    There have also been several redesigns of varying magnitude since the first unified page.</p>

<h1>Code and standards</h1>
<p>Wadny.com is entirely hand-written <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, all running on a <a href="http://www.php.net/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">PHP</a> backend. I have tried very hard to ensure that all pages
    are as valid as possible. XHTML is served with an <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> <abbr
        title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension">MIME</abbr> type to browsers that support it.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I make extensive use of semantic elements, including proper headings, acronyms, code
    markup, and the like. Tables are only used to mark up tabular data, such as the calendar. Layout is done entirely
    with CSS. A standards-compliant browser such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Mozilla</a> is highly encouraged—Internet Explorer will understand most of
    my site, but you will definitely lose some functionality (such as the external link arrows) if you use it.</p>
<p>Some info on understanding this site: unvisited links are blue, visited links are red. If you’re fortunate
    enough to have a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-compliant browser (Mozilla, Firebird, Camino,
    Opera, Safari, etc.) some links will have a little red arrow next to them (<a href="#" rel="external">like
        this</a>)—these links point to a url outside of this site, and usually open in a new browser window. There
    are non-external links that open in new windows, and there might be unmarked external links, but the arrows should
    help.</p>

<h1>Typography</h1>
<p>Typography on the web is difficult—there’s no guarantee your readers will have even one of the fonts you
    want to use, and if they’re using lynx you might as well not even bother. As such, I have kept
    wadny.com’s typography fairly simple.</p>
<p>The body text should be a simple sans-serif font (probably Verdana on Windows, and Lucida Grande on Macintosh OS X).
    The headings are hopefully Palatino Linotype, which I think is absolutely gorgeous; if you’re unlucky enough
    not to have it, the fallback is Times New Roman (shudder) or plain Times (which I believe is a font on some Unixes).
    The images in the sidebar may be hand-rendered text; I didn’t make them, so I don’t know.</p>
<p>I have also tried to ensure that all punctuation is correct, by inserting <abbr
        title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> character entities for quotes, dashes, ellipses, and other
    special characters. The effect is subtle, but I believe it is a worthwhile enhancement. These character entities are
    turned into actual UTF-8 characters by the PHP backend, to save bandwidth and provide you with pure, actual text.
</p>

<h1>Production</h1>
<p>Virtually everything on this site is hand-made by me (the icons and sidebar link images being notable exceptions). I
    currently use <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Programmer’s
        Notepad</a> for editing text and <a href="http://www.jasc.com/products/paintshoppro/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Paint Shop Pro 7</a> for editing images. Many of the icons in the heading are from
    <a href="http://www.kottke.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Jason Kottke’s</a> weblog.</p>
<p>Wadny.com is currently hosted by <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">phpwebhosting.com</a>, which has been a little slow at times but has been very
    reliable and up-to-date. Their server runs Linux with Apache (of course), PHP, and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">MySQL</a>. My site also makes use of <a
        href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">HTML Tidy</a> to sanitize
    comment text.</p>
