title: CSS updates, Alienware call
---
<p>A bunch of little CSS changes and stuff… headings and submenus now have little borders around them, some redundant
    CSS rules were removed, and the search boxes at the bottom are now default colors instead of the same yellow as the
    rest of the site. Also, you may not be able to tell, but I changed the yellow color (*gasp*!). It’s now a lighter
    yellow that isn’t quite so gold, and I like it better. I also added validator links to the sidebar so you can
    confirm that this site is valid <abbr title="eXtensible (or eXtended) HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>
    and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, although since I use a <a href="/xhtml11-target.dtd"
        title="The custom wadny.com DTD - feel free to use it for yourself, if you so desire">custom <abbr
            title="Document Type Definition">DTD</abbr></a>, the W3C validator doesn’t realize my page is XHTML 1.1.
    Oh well.</p>
<p>Gotta go eat dinner now, updates on <abbr title="Real Life">RL</abbr> coming soon.</p>

    <p>Update @ 8:17pm:
        <br>Well, I got the confirmation call from Alienware today to confirm shipping address and credit card info
        and that sort of stuff, so the computer should be officially ordered now. Of course, I’ll be at <abbr
            title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr> before we get it, so setting it up will be a real
        pain.</p>
    <p>However, there’s also some good news: there’s another <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr> party
        planned for this Friday, so I’ll get a chance to meet with “the gang” before we all head off for college. With
        any luck we might actually have some fun and play some games, too. It’s too bad I won’t be able to bring the
        Alienware system, though… that would probably be quite a spectacle. :-D</p>
