Well, that was a fun weekend. The LAN party on Saturday wasn’t quite what I hoped it was going to be, but it wasn’t too bad. It took forever for anyone to show up, so I spent an hour or so watching Kevin Warner play GTA3 and SoF2. After people finally showed up, we did a bit of gaming but the network was all fucked up so we didn’t do as much as usual. There was a bit of Counter-Strike, Tribes 2, and GTA2, but most of the time was spent just goofing off. It wasn’t too bad, though. I managed to score GTA3 off someone else, although my comp can’t run it for shit. Everything else I have runs fine, but GTA3 was stuttering and running really slow. Oh well. After the LAN, four of us went out for a 1am IHOP run. Mmm, french toast… good stuff. Got to sleep around 2 or 2:30 am.

I woke up around 1pm on Sunday and staggered around for a bit before settling down to watch the Portland CART race. Too bad Max Papis had to sit it out, Sigma really needs some funding, but I was glad to hear CART is sticking with Ford and the turbo engines. Switching to the IRL engine formula would just waste money and lose fans. I don’t want to give away the ending for anyone who hasn’t seen it, so I’ll just say this: wheel nuts are supposed to STAY ON.

I think that’s about it for my weekend; I did quite a bit of stuff but it was almost all on Saturday. I missed all of the Le Mans coverage, but my dad taped it all so I need to watch that soon. The Joest Audis probably won again, but I still want to see what happened.

Tune in tomorrow for the aftermath of my Regents Physics exam!
