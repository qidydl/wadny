    <h2>What is this page for?</h2>
    <p>The news page on wadny.com is more than just a list of entries—it’s nearly a full-featured weblog.  Thus, I feel I should explain a few of its features and
       capabilites, to make it easier to use.</p>
    <h2>The archives</h2>
    <p>Every news post ever made with the current system—going back to September 2000—is available through the archives system.  You start by clicking on the Archives link
       in the sidebar.  From there, you can select a year, then a month in that year, then a day in that month, and then finally a specific news post.  There are no categories (and
       probably never will be), but hopefully you can find what you’re looking for.  If not, you can try your favorite search engine with “site:wadny.com”.  Google can be slow to update
       sometimes, but anything new enough to not be in Google is probably on or near the front page.</p>
    <h2>The calendar</h2>
    <p>Another way to get at recent posts is the calendar in the sidebar.  It should be fairly straightforward: click on the name of the year to go to the monthly archives, click on the
       name of the month to get to the daily archives, click on a specific day to go to that day’s archives.  The current day (according to <abbr title="Eastern Standard Time">
       EST</abbr>) is highlighted in white.</p>
    <h2>Syndication</h2>
    <p>In addition to the front page and archives, the 10 most recent posts on my site are also available through two different <abbr
       title="RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication, depending on who you talk to">RSS</abbr> feeds.  There are many programs available for viewing <abbr>RSS</abbr>
       feeds; they usually allow you to add a list of feeds and have the program check at regular intervals to see which ones have updated.  Both of mine are in <abbr>RSS</abbr>
       2.0; one has full post text with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and the other has only summaries with no HTML but has an <abbr 
       title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> stylesheet so if you view it in a web browser, it looks just like a regular page.  Both of my feeds should validate.</p>
    <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
    <p>My news system also includes the ability for readers to post comments attached to a specific news post.  There is no registration required and you can lie all you want, but I
       reserve the right to edit comments however I see fit, including deleting them entirely.  Also, your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address is logged when you
       post a comment (primarily for the purpose of banning spammers).  It cannot be accessed through the site, so it’s safe from other people, and I promise I won’t do
       anything stupid with it—I have no reason to chase away any tiny number of readers that may I have.  In addition, comments are automatically sanitized to keep my page valid.
       Non-<abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> characters are transformed into numerical character entities automatically.  All
       <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> tags are stripped except for &lt;a&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt;, &lt;acronym&gt;, &lt;big&gt;, &lt;code&gt;,
       &lt;em&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;.  <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> are similarly sanitized, but they don’t
       have to actually be valid URLs—if they 404, I don’t care.  Note that you can put any type of URL you want in the field, and if you put in an e-mail address, the
       <code>mailto:</code> is automatically prepended.</p>
    <h2 id="trackbacks">TrackBacks</h2>
    <p>Late in August 2002, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - A popular weblog publishing system">MovableType</a> introduced a system
       called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - The official TrackBack development site">TrackBack</a> that basically lets
       you tell the author of a TrackBack-enabled website when you’ve made a post that might interest them.  It works by giving each post on a site a unique TrackBack <abbr
       title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> that accepts TrackBack “pings.”  You can then send a TrackBack ping (basically a simple <abbr
       title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> POST message) to that <abbr>URL</abbr> and it gets sent to the author or recorded and displayed on the page or whatever
       that particular weblog system does with TrackBack pings.  My site displays any TrackBacks after comments on the single-post page.  Please note that, as with comments, the 
       <abbr>IP</abbr> address of whoever submitted the TrackBack ping is logged, in case spammers start going after TrackBack as well, and I reserve the right to edit TrackBacks
       however I see fit, including deleting them entirely.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My news system does a lot of different things, and it takes quite a bit of code to run, but it shouldn’t be too hard to use.  If you think anything is named confusingly or
       could work better, post a comment or send me an e-mail (there’s a link in the sidebar) and I’ll see what I can do.</p>
