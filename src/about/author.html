<p>My name is David, and this is wadny.com. I’m a software engineer in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, with
    a degree in software engineering from <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr>. I’ve been
    programming since high school (2000-ish) and working in the software field since 2007.</p>
<p>I started out doing C++ in high school and PHP for various personal website projects, including earlier iterations
    of this one. In college I moved on to Java and some Python, and started learning about design using
    <abbr title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr> and Rational Rose. After graduating, it was back to C++ for five
    and a half years, this time on Linux. Since mid-2013, I’ve migrated into the world of web applications and cloud
    services on the .NET platform, with a fair amount of <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> and
    JavaScript mixed in. More details are in my <a href="/professional/">professional information</a>.</p>

    <p>I used to be heavily into the desktop customizing scene on Windows for many years, going back to the days when
        Windows 98 was as good as it got. I used to use Litestep and several other programs to do some rather serious
        customization work, but nowadays I’ve moved on to Linux and also shifted my priorities more towards things being
        simple and reliable rather than looking exactly a certain way. It helps that the default UIs have gotten a lot
        better as well.</p>

        <h3 id="wallpaper">Wallpaper</h3>
        <p>Sadly, most of the sites in the customizing scene that I used to get wallpaper from have disappeared or died
            off, so I’m not sure what good sources there are out there any more. Here are the small handful I know of
            that are still online.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <p>I only have a few wallpaper images I use currently. I did not make any of these, I claim no ownership or
            copyright or license for them, and I’m not sure where they all came from, although a couple are watermarked
            and clearly from Desktopography.</p>
