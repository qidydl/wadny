title: Random changes

I made a bunch of backend changes that should make errors much nicer-looking (for example, the error when you click on a menu item that I haven’t had time to fill in yet). I also got most of the Band section filled in, but please don’t tell everyone to download the mp3s from here—email them, ICQ them, set up a mirror, put them on Napster, whatever.

If, for some strange reason, you have a burning desire for a wadny.com email address, you can <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript" onclick="location.href=email(); return false">ask me</a> for one. There’s no real space limit, but I’ll probably prune anything more than a month old and boot anyone using more than 10 or 15mb (you shouldn’t be sending or receiving anything that big anyways).
