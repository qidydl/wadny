title: Spam is evil.
---
<p>Doing all this work on my news system has been, basically, a royal pain in the butt. It takes a lot of time and
    effort and trying different things and debugging when PHP suddenly blows up in my face and in the end I still don’t
    have all the features that come with your average blog software—but it’s all worth it, because I don’t have to deal
    with <a href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000289.html" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - “Like crap, falling from the sky”">this</a>.</p>

<p>There is now an automated system for spamming weblogs based on <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - MovableType, a weblog publishing system">MovableType</a>. Apparently, on <a
        href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/01/12/mt_comment_s/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Mezzoblue: MT Comment Spam">weblogs</a> that actually get traffic (read: not
    mine), comment spam has finally started to register; some people are getting hit pretty bad. I expect that
    auto-spamming tools will follow for other weblogging systems.</p>
<p>However—and this is where all my work pays off—I don’t have to care. My entire website is custom-written PHP. It’s
    not based on anything else, it’s not used anywhere else, and none of the technical details are published anywhere.
    There is no tool for auto-spamming my site, and somehow I doubt there ever will be one. I can’t imagine the spammers
    being so desperate to reach my readership that they would resort to a custom tool or manual comment entry, but if
    they are, I have something to say to them: I am ready.</p>
<p>Spammers have no scruples when it comes to spreading their message. They will resort to anything—legal or illegal—to
    keep sending spam. I, on the other hand, have no scruples when it comes to avoiding spam. I will blacklist <abbr
        title="Internet Protocol addresses">IPs</abbr> and hostnames, or even entire <abbr
        title="Internet Service Providers">ISPs</abbr> and address blocks. Someone gets blacklisted accidentally and
    they want off the list? Too bad, get your ISP to stop hosting spammers.</p>
<p>I’ll add comment text parsing to ban anything that looks like spam. I’ll disable comments completely or even move the
    site to a pure whitelist system, if necessary, to ensure that my site does’t get used for purposes I don’t approve
    of. You want to get my hosting provider to kick me off? I’ll relocate to a nice academic server that happens to be
    run by a committee of students, and they certainly won’t listen to you. Good luck attacking my site name, unless you
    have prior art from before the 1970’s. The domain name is registered by a relative, and he won’t take kindly to any
    interference. We know good lawyers. Mark Pilgrim has commented on <a
