title: Exam afterthoughts
---
I just had the first of my two exams today, this one was Regents English 12. Not surprisingly, it was damned easy; I could have just BSed the whole thing and probably passed, but I tried a little and wrote a couple decent essays. Bummed a ride home from a friend… damn, I need a license and a car.

Just so you know, I made some more random site changes: I moved all the CSS pages to a subfolder to clean up a bit, added an aural CSS page for my nonexistent blind audience (or anyone who feels like having my website read to them, god only knows why), and updated my [playlist]({% link misc/playlist.html %}). Oh, that’s right, I forgot to mention: my winamp playlist is posted on wadny.com, in case anyone cares about what I listen to or wants to leech songs off me.

I’m trying to get psyched up for the lan party I’m hosting tomorrow, but it sounds like the weather is gonna be pretty sucky and all kinds of people have to leave in the middle or show up late. Bah. If anyone lives in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area (well, a little south of it, but close enough) and wants to come to a lan party and isn’t insane, drop me a line. If the party gets too boring, we’ll just take a field trip to a local concert nearby. Ok, I can’t think of anything else to write about for now, so maybe I’ll throw on some more later or just leave it.
