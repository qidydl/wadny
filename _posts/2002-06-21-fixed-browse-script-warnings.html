title: Fixed browse script warnings
---
<p>Ok, just a quick update.  There were some more problems with big piles of warnings and crap on a different page, so I went ahead and fixed the real cause of the problem instead of hacking on a fix like I did last time.  Theoretically, everything works now.</p>
<p>For anyone who cares, the problem was part of my browse script—there are some functions that other pages use to get a list of files in a directory, and those functions were depending on a variable that the browse page set but wasn’t getting set by the other pages.  I fixed it so one of the functions sets a different variable and they all use that now.</p>
