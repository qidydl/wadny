<td>Each package has a monthly cost and an upgrade cost.  The monthly cost is charged each month and the upgrade cost whenever I change the site (noticeably.  Things like spell correction or link changes or other small stuff aren't charged).  You pick one of these, depending on how often you plan on changing your site.  Various CGI and Java programs will cost extra if I have to buy them from someone, but those are usually inexpensive (usually).</td>

<center><font color="#099C41"><img src="../dot2.gif"> Package 1: Simple Website</font></center>
<p>This package includes all of the basic services, and can include images, sounds, tables, and text formatting (colors and such).  This may not sound like much, but I could have built this page with only those things (the only thing missing from here is frames, but I could have had a little menu at the bottom of each page).  Stylesheets are also included, but that's just .css files, not DHTML-type content blocks.
<pre>Setup:   $100
Monthly: $10
Update:  $15</pre>
<p><center><font color="#099C41"><img src="../dot2.gif"> Package 2: Advanced Website</font></center>
<p>This package is useful if you want more communication with your users and ease of use for your website.  Options (plus the basic ones) are frames, forms (for comments, ordering, bug reports, etc.) imagemaps, and simple Javascript (such as the snippet of code I use to make sure my pages aren't stuck in frames).
<pre>Setup:   $150
Monthly: $15
Update:  $20</pre>
<p><center><font color="#099C41"><img src="../dot2.gif"> Package 3: Maximum Website</font></center>
<p>This package offers you the most capabilities, but is often the most complicated and time-consuming.  The options here (plus basic and advanced) are Java applets (like a TickerTape), a message board, a search page, and any CGI or Java thing you want that I can find or make.  As I said, some might cost extra.  Basically, with this package, just about anything goes.
<pre>Setup:   $250
Monthly: $25
Update:  $30</pre>
<p><center><font color="#099C41"><img src="../dot2.gif"> Package 4: Custom Website</font></center>
<p>If you don't want to use a specific package, you can opt for a custom website.  With this option, you can request whatever you want (I might not be able to do some things, such as Flash), and I'll make a specific bill for your site.  This is more cost effective if you're using a simple design, but want to add only one or two things from the next step up.  At some point, I may move specifically to per-design pricing, but I'll have to get a feel for what people will pay first.</td>
