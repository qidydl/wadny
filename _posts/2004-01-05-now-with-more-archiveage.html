title: Now with more archiveage
---
<p>I’ve got virtually all of the news archives up and running, although they might not look all that great. The daily
    archives page is pretty ugly, I’m going to replace it with some calendar-like thing, or at least something better
    than a list of every day in the month. Some old <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> forms need
    to be redirected to the new system so links aren’t broken, and I also can’t edit the archives at the moment. I might
    just reorganize the entire system to reduce duplicated code, but not tonight. The sidebar calendar is up and running
    and comments should work. Still a lot of work left to do…</p>
