title: May 1<sup>st</sup> redesign
---
Wow, this is getting so much better… welcome to the May 1st redesign of qid.stals.com! Not everything’s working right yet, but what does work is much nicer than the sprawling mess I had before. If you can’t find something, go to Browse and hunt around a bit—I don’t think there’s anything missing that isn’t somewhere else. I’ve got a bunch of school stuff going on right now (<acronym title="Advanced Placement">AP</acronym> exam, project for health, trip to Cornell University this weekend) but I’ll try to put in some work on everything over the next couple weeks. Don’t worry, when this is done, the site will be a lot better than what it was before.
