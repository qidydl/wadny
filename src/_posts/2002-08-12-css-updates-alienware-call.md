title: CSS updates, Alienware call
---
A bunch of little CSS changes and stuff… headings and submenus now have little borders around them, some redundant CSS rules were removed, and the search boxes at the bottom are now default colors instead of the same yellow as the rest of the site. Also, you may not be able to tell, but I changed the yellow color (*gasp*!). It’s now a lighter yellow that isn’t quite so gold, and I like it better. I also added validator links to the sidebar so you can confirm that this site is valid XHTML and CSS, although since I use a custom DTD, the W3C validator doesn’t realize my page is XHTML 1.1. Oh well.

Gotta go eat dinner now, updates on RL coming soon.

<ins datetime="2002-08-12T20:17:40-05:00">Update @ 8:17pm: Well, I got the confirmation call from Alienware today to confirm shipping address and credit card info and that sort of stuff, so the computer should be officially ordered now. Of course, I’ll be at RIT before we get it, so setting it up will be a real pain.</ins>

<ins datetime="2002-08-12T20:17:40-05:00">However, there’s also some good news: there’s another LAN party planned for this Friday, so I’ll get a chance to meet with “the gang” before we all head off for college. With any luck we might actually have some fun and play some games, too. It’s too bad I won’t be able to bring the Alienware system, though… that would probably be quite a spectacle. :-D</ins>
