[13:09:43] <DSlicer-w0rking> My cable modem is better than most, though, since we have a small user base
[13:10:06] <DSlicer-w0rking> And we were one of the first places to get it
[13:10:09] <Defiler> so that is  a factor also....
[13:10:14] <@R1CH> i got the username anyway
[13:10:38] <DSlicer-w0rking> Yeah, cable modem is a shared connection
[13:11:05] <DSlicer-w0rking> So some idiot running a p0rn server in your area will kill your connection

[13:51:15] <LostAngel> why dont you help me daddy?
[13:51:17] <Defiler> ok obviously that url is why over my head
[13:51:47] <Defiler> you write your own hax0r tools to do stuff like that 
[13:51:51] <Defiler> ?
[13:52:22] <Defiler> so obviously I need to learn a coding language first
[13:52:23] <ghost-> where do all the imported files come from?

[13:53:30] <Defiler> so u decompile the page u need to have a grasp of html?
[13:53:39] <DaddyDeath> no.
[13:53:49] <DaddyDeath> you need to know java if i send you the source code to his applet
[13:53:51] <ghost-> yay a for loop!
[13:53:54] <ghost-> i know for loops!
[13:53:56] <QID|YDL> you decompile the java class or vb program
[13:54:19] <QID|YDL> ghost-: search the file for where it puts data into inuser
[13:54:28] <ghost-> i have
[13:54:29] <DaddyDeath> i showed him that section..
