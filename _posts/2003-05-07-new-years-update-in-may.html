title: New Year’s update (in May)
---
Hmm, it’s been a long time since my last update.  As you can see, the website has been seriously redesigned, and there’s been plenty of stuff worth talking about.  As soon as I get the news post script to not suck, I’ll make a real update.
<p>Also, I would like to note that my soul has since been traded to Dungeon Siege and from there to Ragnarok Online, where it currently resides.</p>
