title: Section access methods
---
<p>For reasons not entirely understood, even by myself, I pretty much rewrote most of the backend again. Basically, you
    can access any page in one of 4 ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The menu entry at the top of the page</li>
    <li>www.wadny.com/&lt;section name&gt;</li>
    <li>www.wadny.com/&lt;section name&gt;/form.php</li>
    <li>&lt;section name&gt;.wadny.com – this only works for sections that I’ve got something for, so try the menu first</li>
</ol>
<p>Just replace &lt;section name&gt; with the lowercase name of a menu item and you can use any of those methods. Please
    <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript"
        onclick="location.href=email(); return false">tell me</a> if one of the methods screws something up (unless it’s
    method 4 and you can’t resolve the domain, since that would be your fault for not following instructions). I’ll
    probably get the design section working next. Form and Gaming are harder, and start might be removed unless I get
    some neat ideas for what to do with it.</p>
