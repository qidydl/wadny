<h2 id="beginning">Beginning of Time–1973</h2>
<p>The year was 1958. It was a simpler time, full of Happy Days (see Nick-at-Nite). Dick &amp; Don were ace science
    students at North Junior High School in Niagara Falls, NY. Both played in the band and orchestra—Dick on trumpet and
    Don on French horn (what nerds!). But that wasn’t enough for this dynamic duo! They wanted young girls fawning over
    them like they did over the good-looking guys… er, make that the other good-looking guys. So they started playing
    guitars and singing just like the Everly Brothers, except that they weren’t brothers and they didn’t have any
    original songs and…</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Larry was somewhere in Cheektowaga, NY, taking accordion lessons, Paul was in Tonawanda, NY, learning how
    to tie his shoes (especially the left one), and Nancy was in Williamsville, NY, freshly potty trained. You might
    (correctly) discern that they are all a bit younger than Dick &amp; Don. But I digress…</p>

<p>So… Dick &amp; Don sang and played “All I Have to Do is Dream” in a variety show at school, and the ball was rolling.
    Over the next couple of years they did more shows and dances, as a duo and with a small group they put together and
    for some long-forgotten reason called “The Whisperers”. They had found another guitarist (also named Larry, but not
    the Wadny one—he was still playing accordion), and to make room for him, Don switched to the electric bass (D&amp;D
    first built one themselves, from plywood, a cheap used pickup, and a neck and strings from an old broken
    mando-cello. It had to be tuned a little higher than a real bass, but it actually worked for a while). By 1960 they
    were backing up a local singing group (the Vel-Tones) and even made a record with Buffalo disc jockey Tom Shannon.
    There was nowhere to go but somewhere else… and that’s just what they did. They went off to different colleges. Dick
    attended the University of Rochester, where he played with “Lee Adrian and the Campus Playboys” and later with “The
    Rivermen”, and Don went to Syracuse where he played guitar with “Gary and the Invaders” (later just “The Invaders”
    after Gary left). During the summer of 1963 Don joined Dick with Lee Adrian et al in Rochester, and then for a
    fun-filled week at the Laurels Resort in the Catskills.</p>

<p>After graduation from college, Don spent four years in the Air Force, while Dick sang folk music with “The Other
    Singers” in Rochester and Buffalo (while attending grad school). When The Other Singers went their various ways in
    1967, Dick and Other Singers partner Mark Pettit (who had sung with Dick &amp; Don as “The Keynoters” in high
    school) formed “Three for the Show” (with singer Sue Caruso and backed by drummer Al Rizzuto), playing commercial
    music in Buffalo area night clubs. Eventually Mark left for bigger things, and when Don got out of the Air Force he
    found a version of “Three for the Show” (now a four-person group?) still playing sappy music in Holiday Inns and
    such. D&amp;D decided to form a new duo, playing folk, light rock, and whatever. Then 1969 came along, the year of
    Woodstock! That weekend was the first time the now semi-famous duo played at an outdoor festival, and the crowds
    were fantastic. Unfortunately, it was at the Lewiston (NY) Art Festival, not Woodstock, but they did periodically
    get reports of what was going on at the other end of the state. It sounded decidedly different form Lewiston!!!</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, they added Ted Szpara on drums, and a new Three for the Show was born (with just three members).
    But in the summer of 1972, when D&amp;D were temporarily doing the “duo thing” at the Frontier House in Lewiston,
    Larry would come in and listen. At this time Larry had given up the accordion and was building and driving sports
    cars in SCCA sponsored events, and he recruited D&amp;D to be the pit crew. We all spent the summer bruising our
    knuckles and getting all greasy, oily, and sore, trying to get Larry’s Austin Healy up and running by day, while the
    D&amp;D duo sang at night. We completely rebuilt the car, changed the engine three or four times, and still the
    thing wouldn’t make two laps without breaking. But when we were all sitting around listening to music, Larry would
    keep time with all his hands and feet (actually the usual human number of them) doing different rhythms. He was
    obviously a natural born drummer, even if he had never sat down at a set of drums. So, one day when Larry wasn’t
    paying attention, Don and Dick huddled in the corner and said “if we can get Larry to play drums maybe we won’t have
    to get all greasy and bruise our knuckles like this any more”. Larry was talked into buying drums (with promises of
    fame and fortune in the music biz) and Ted was never seen or heard from again (kind of like Peter Best of the
    Beatles).</p>

<p>Rehearsals began in the fall of 1972. Don and Dick had been doing all the singing with Three for the Show, but Larry
    apparently had musical good taste (he even refuses to play the accordion any more) and he suggested we look for a
    vocalist. At the time Dick was teaching at Erie Community College and one day he was standing in the hall when he
    heard some clown walking along singing <b class="big">“Born Free”</b>. (Note: that’s not just “Born Free”, but
    actually <b class="big">“Born Free”</b>!). It was Paul, and Dick immediately decided that by channeling this
    prodigious vocal energy into the group he might preserve the sanity of his colleagues in academia. And thus a new
    quartet was born.</p>

<p>The unique name “Catharsis” was chosen, and we were ready. So was another group with the unique name “Catharsis”,
    which hit the Buffalo papers before we did. So we picked a new name that was ours alone, we had our business cards
    made, and “Crossroads” hit the Buffalo scene. We played our first job (a middle school dance) in January of 1973,
    less than five (5) months after Larry first touched a set of drums.</p>

<h2 id="a1973">1973</h2>

<p>We made it through the whole of 1973 as “Crossroads”, but then the inevitable happened—the first Buffalo performance
    by an out-of-town group called—say it with us—“Crossroads”. The other “Crossroads” had guns, or at least more fans,
    so we changed our name again.</p>

<h2 id="awadny">1974–1987: The WADNY Years</h2>

<p>This time, we decided to name the band after a little-known hero from the Shenandoah Valley—the semi-great Anselmo
    Wadny. (For the real story, go to <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/dickhull/wadny/thename.htm" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">The Real Story</a>). And nobody stole it! It was our name! We had business cards
    to prove it!</p>

<p>We played all kinds of jobs, from junior high school and college dances to wedding receptions to private parties and
    things like that. We generally avoided playing in bars and clubs because we didn’t want to make the time commitment.
    Advertising was strictly word-of-mouth, but we kept as busy as we wanted most of the time.</p>

<p>Things rolled along pretty smoothly for several years, until Paul decided he should play an instrument. He tried
    congas, bongos, cow bell, tambourine, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and harmonica. All of these managed to add
    something to the fullness of the Wadny sound, but eventually we decided we needed more. Luckily, at some point in
    there, Larry had married a keyboard player, Nancy. In spite of all the possible dangers of adding a spouse to the
    group, Nancy joined Wadny in late 1981, and we were now a five-member quintet (as opposed to some other sized
    quintet). We even let Paul continue to play the guitar once in a while, and we ended up with quite a full sound—four
    voices and four-and-a-half instruments (you’d understand this if you ever heard Paul play).</p>

<h2 id="a8788">1987–1988</h2>

<p>In 1987, Dick got a great chance to leave the cold white north behind. He headed for Hickory, North Carolina, where
    he joined the faculty of Lenoir-Rhyne College. The rest of the band refused to follow and ended up floundering
    around for a while.</p>

<h2 id="a8890">1988–1990</h2>

<p>1988 found a new lead guitarist with Wadny—Bob Ruszanowski. He was quite a talented guy, with a very different style
    from Dick, and the band kept busy for a couple of years before Bob decided one job every couple of months just
    wasn’t cutting it. He took off for more active pastures. “Wadny” was no more (insert sound of sad violins).</p>

<h2 id="a90present">1990–present</h2>

<p>Don, Larry, Paul, and Nancy found Curt Smith to play guitar, but after rehearsing for a while, Paul decided he
    couldn’t continue with the band, now renamed. A brief attempt with another singer eventually came to an end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dick was in (or near) the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and traded in his electric guitars for
    acoustic ones. He and his wife Carol sang for a while with a couple of other faculty members, using the name “Forty
    Something”. In the fall of 1991, while Dick was teaching in England, he and Carol started putting together some folk
    duets, and upon returning to the U.S. started performing as “Something Else”.</p>

<p>Dick also began playing bass with the François Vola Group (jazz) and appears on their first CD (“Old World,
    New World”) on RDC Records (Paris, France). He also played bass with guitarist François and mandolinist Emory
    Lester at festivals such as MerleFest and in the Hickory area. In addition to Something Else, he continues to play
    guitar and/or bass in local jazz groups, including the Lenoir-Rhyne Jazz Ensemble.</p>

<p>Larry played in another group for a while, but Nancy and Paul have essentially retired from the business. Currently
    Larry and Don have put a new rock group together in the Buffalo, NY, area. Watch for “Jump the Shark” if you’re in
    the area.</p>
