<h3>popular channels</h3>
<p>EdgeIRC is still a small network, so there really aren't that many popular channels.  Some of the ones we have are listed here.</p>

<h3>#anime</h3>
<p>A channel for talking about and trading anime (please note that EdgeIRC does not officially support the sharing of copyrighted works).</p>

<h3>#coders</h3>
<p>A useful channel for discussing coding and getting help with coding-related problems.  If you have questions about coding or computers in general,
   stop by and we'll try to help you out, or at least point you to people who can.</p>

<h3>#edge</h3>
<p>This is the official network channel, for IRCops and anyone that needs help.  Stop by if you have a question or want to report something (flooding,
   ban evading, or something else ops can't handle) and we'll try to fix it, but don't come looking for intriguing conversation.</p>

<h3>#egl</h3>
<p>The official development channel for Echon's Quake II OpenGL library.</p>

<h3>#gloom</h3>
<p>The official channel for Gloom, a Quake 2 mod made by Team Reaction, this is the most populous channel on the network.  All of the admins are
   regulars from here, when it was on another network, and a couple were ops.  If you're looking for conversation of any kind, it's most likely
   here.</p>

<h3>#q3gloom</h3>
<p>Like the name says, this is a channel for the still-in-development version of Gloom for Quake 3.</p>

<h3>#studio64</h3>
<p>The official chatroom of Nintendorks.com, but video games are hardly the only topic of discussion. Feel free to join if you're in the mood for
   wacky shenanigans.</p>
