        title="Opens in a new window - jogin.com: Back on crack">Tomas Jogin has found more evidence</a>. Mr. Winer,
    seriously: give it a rest. If RSS is so superior and so widely used, then why are you so scared of Atom? And why are
    you so eager to monopolize on one syndication format? Different formats may suit different applications, and trying
    to force a square application into a round format isn’t going to work any better than pegs and holes. And what if
    Atom is better? If people don’t want to use RSS, trying to force it down their throats won’t change anything. Let
    the people decide what they want. If they choose Atom, then so be it.</p>
