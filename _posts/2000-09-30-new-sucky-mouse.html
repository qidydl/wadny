<p>There’s some more humor stuff on <abbr title="First-Person Shooter Information Database">FPSID</abbr>, go check it out.</p>
<p>I just got some kind of optical intellimouse, since my old normal logitech wheelmouse was getting worn out. I wish I had done some more research or something, this one doesn’t work as well as I’d hoped. The scroll wheel doesn’t work in all applications and sometimes it either scrolls too much or too little and the software doesn’t change it… ugh… maybe I can return it.  :-|</p>
