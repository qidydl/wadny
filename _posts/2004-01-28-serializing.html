title: Serializing
---
<p>I just filled out an International Standard Serial Number (or ISSN) application.  For those who don’t know, <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/issn/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">an ISSN is</a> a unique serial number for identifying periodicals, also known as serials.  A serial is a publication issued in successive parts and intended to be continued indefinitely, with issues having unique numerical designations.  Weblogs meet the definition of a serial, and thus qualify for an ISSN.  Joe Clark has a page that <a href="http://fawny.org/issn/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">explains the benefits of ISSNs</a>, and another page that <a href="http://fawny.org/issn/compatibility/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">explains why weblogs are eligible for ISSNs</a>.  I decided to join the likes of <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Jeffery Zeldman</a> (ISSN 1534-0309) and get an ISSN for wadny.com.  Hopefully I’ll be approved, although I have no idea how long the process takes.</p>
<p>P.S.: I know I still haven’t added any new designs or written the article I mentioned; I’ll get to it eventually.</p>

<br />The application form is in the mail; I’m guessing a few weeks before I get anything back (this is the federal government, after all).</ins></p>
