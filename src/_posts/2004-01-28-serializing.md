title: Serializing
---
I just filled out an International Standard Serial Number application. For those who don’t know, [an ISSN is](http://lcweb.loc.gov/issn/){:rel='external'} a unique serial number for identifying periodicals, also known as serials. A serial is a publication issued in successive parts and intended to be continued indefinitely, with issues having unique numerical designations. Weblogs meet the definition of a serial, and thus qualify for an ISSN. Joe Clark has a page that [explains the benefits of ISSNs](http://fawny.org/issn/){:rel='external'}, and another page that [explains why weblogs are eligible for ISSNs](http://fawny.org/issn/compatibility/){:rel='external'}. I decided to join the likes of [Jeffery Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/){:rel='external'} (ISSN 1534-0309) and get an ISSN for wadny.com. Hopefully I’ll be approved, although I have no idea how long the process takes.

P.S.: I know I still haven’t added any new designs or written the article I mentioned; I’ll get to it eventually.
