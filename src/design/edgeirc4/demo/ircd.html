<h3>about EdgeIRCD</h3>
<p>EdgeIRCD is a brand-new, built-from-scratch IRC daemon currently under development on our network.  Several of the server admins decided that, although
   Cyclone had served us well for several years, it was lacking some features we would like to have.  Also, we have been having some issues with our services,
   and we are interested in building a server with integrated, improved services.</p>
