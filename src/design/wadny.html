<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is it—the big one, the crème de la crème. Wadny.com is the most advanced, complex, and experimental site in my
    design portfolio, incorporating a custom weblogging system, dynamic menus, directory browsing, and much more.</p>
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>Since this is my personal site, I have no qualms about employing standards that may not be fully supported yet.
    Fortunately, in modern times, this is almost entirely unnecessary, as the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>6
    demon has been slain, and all modern browsers are at least reasonably standards-compliant. Wadny.com is built with
    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5 and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 2 (and a
    little CSS3). Every page should validate properly, including the CSS. Wadny.com is also <a
        href="/about/accessibility/" title="My accessibility statement">highly accessible</a>.</p>
<h3>Visual design</h3>
<p>Being a weblog, wadny.com is designed with the typical two-column layout. The visual design is intended to be simple
    and readable, and scale cleanly with adjusted font sizes. The yellow line between the header and content is the
    “theme color” of wadny.com, dating back long ago to designs I don’t even have any record of. The sidebar is shaded
    to add a little more color to the page; the color of the sidebar changes depending on the header I use. During the
    winter, I had a yellow-shaded header, so the sidebar was tinted blue. In the spring, I changed to a blue header, so
    the sidebar became yellow-tinted.</p>
<p>For visual display, body text uses a simple sans-serif font (probably Verdana) and headings use a serif font
    (hopefully Palatino Linotype). For print display, however, body text switches to a serif font (probably Georgia) for
    improved readability on paper. This is thanks to CSS media types.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>TODO: Rewrite all this, along with the colophon.</p>
<p>Wadny.com is written entirely in PHP, with a MySQL database storing news posts, comments, and a handful of other
    things. This allows me to quickly and easily add pages and sections, rearrange the site, and control how my page is
    served up. It also allows for dynamic content, such as the icon and tagline in the heading, and the calendar in the
    sidebar. However, my site is written to be technology-independent: if I switch from PHP to, say, ASP, none of the
    URLs have to change and the site remains usable.</p>
<p>The news system on my site contains many advanced features, including comments, TrackBack support, automatic Atom
    feed generation, automatic aggregator pinging, and a blogroll feed generator.</p>
<p>My site also contains an easily configurable directory browsing front-end. It displays icons for files and also
    allows me to deny certain files or directories from being displayed. It even allows you to provide a directory index
    file, like FTP does.</p>
