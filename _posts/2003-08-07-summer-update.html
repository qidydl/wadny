title: Summer update
---
Dangit, now that shinji got his <a href="http://www.rapidhate.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - shinji's goofy little weblog">website</a> hosted on <a href="http://www.r1hosting.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Hosting by R1CH - highly recommended">r1hosting</a>, he’s making my update schedule look positively lethargic.  Perhaps if more happened in my life I would post more, but, eh…
<p>Last night was the annual <a href="http://www.scca.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Sports Car Club of America">SCCA</a> picnic here in the <a href="http://www.wny-scca.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Western New York region Sports Car Club of America">Western NY region</a>.  Good food, got to hang around with a bunch of cool people.  Oh, and I got a ride in a brand-new M3.  :-D  Such a kickass car… if only I could afford one.</p>
<p>Something else that’s sort of cool: I am now the proud owner of possibly the only Nerf <a href="/pictures/Sharpshooter%20II.jpg" title="Picture of my Nerf Sharpshooter II">Sharpshooter II</a> with a custom-fabricated <a href="/pictures/Sharpshooter%20II%20pull%20ring.jpg" title="Picture of the aluminum pull ring">aluminum pull ring</a> (or aluminium for the brits).  I think it looks pretty nice, and at least I can use the gun again.</p>
<p>The biggest event since my last post, I got one of my wisdom teeth out.  My god, that was an unpleasant experience.  The surgery itself was disgusting enough to still make me feel sick to my stomach when I recall it, but fortunately not horrifically painful.  The recovery was more annoying, having to chew on one side of my mouth for a week and deal with the pain, which was rather annoying at times.  Realistically, though, it was easy to get through, and it’s been about a month and I’m back to normal now.</p>
<p>What else happened since my last update that’s worth knowing?  Not a whole lot… spent a couple days helping my dad with roofing work on the house, that was highly not fun.  Got an air conditioner and returned it because it sucked.  Got a new Klipsch <a href="http://www.klipsch.com/product/product.aspx?cid=103" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Promedia 2.1</a> speaker system, a HUGE improvement over the intermittent and wimpy Boston Acoustics system I had before.  Installed linux on my laptop and discovered my wireless card is virtually unsupported, I’ll try putting Win2K on there next.  I’ll post more as I remember.</p>
<p>What’s coming up in the future?  In a couple weeks the parents and I pack up the motorhome and head north for the <a href="http://www.americanlemans.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">American Le Mans Series</a> Grand Prix at <a href="http://www.mosport.com/2003/alms.htm" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Mosport</a>, which will hopefully have better weather than the yucky rain we got last year.  I head back to <a href="http://www.rit.edu/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</a> on September 5, I’m actually looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Ok, I’ll leave it at that for now.</p>
