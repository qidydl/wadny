title: www. is deprecated
---
<p>I just made my site <a href="http://no-www.org" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">no-www</a> class B compliant.  In other words, requests for www.wadny.com/(anything) are silently redirected to wadny.com/(anything).  Old links are not broken, and users shouldn’t notice a difference, but it makes me feel better.  I got the idea from <a href="http://rapidhate.org" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Kevin</a>, who is also class B compliant but hasn’t admitted it.</p>
<p>In other news, I’ve been working on getting a few other designs up in the Design section.  They might appear in a few days, and I’ll make another post with details if they do.  I may also have another big essay-style post (à la My 2¢ on Postel’s Law) in the coming days.  We’ll see.</p>

<br />Some people have gotten the mistaken impression that the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> has officially deprecated the use of “www.” in <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</acronym> or something similar.  That’s just silly.  If you read the <a href="http://no-www.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">No-www</a> website, you can see that it’s just a logical idea that someone had and I happen to agree with it.  That’s it.</ins></p>
