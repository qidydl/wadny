title: Wallpapers and news changes
---
I don’t know if I’ve been mentioning this every time, but I’ve been throwing up various new wallpapers in the [desktop+wallpaper]({% link about/author.md %}#desktop) section. I might be going through them at some point and weeding out ones that aren’t quite as good anymore.

You’ll also notice a few changes in the news page, mainly an ‘edit’ button at the bottom. I did some screwing around with the news script and made it a little better, and also added the option for me to edit existing posts. I’m considering making a release of this, but it’s pretty complex…

I also added a few new random titles and removed a couple old ones, so keep your eye out for those.

BTW, from now on, multiple posts in one day will probably be edited together like this, instead of posted separately.
