title: Major overhaul
---
Ok, now that I’ve got the news posting system working (and I don’t have to manually add entries with the SQL frontend) I’ll go ahead and post on what’s changed.
<p>First, and most obviously, I’ve seriously redesigned the site.  I’m still hemming and hawing over various parts of it, but I think this is good enough.  There are parts I need to put back in still—the multisearch form, aural and print styleshets, and I want to get the “open external links in a new window” checkbox working properly with cookies so it saves your choice.</p>
<p>You’ll notice a few links are missing—the help page is gone, since I somehow doubt that anyone would have difficulty understanding my website now.  Website design links are now under about &gt; links (makes sense, doesn’t it?).  The validation links have moved to the footer.</p>
<p>Also, the backend has gotten some overhaul—a few sections are structured more logically now, and I’m converting other sections to the new system, so there might be brief periods where a section is broken while I’m converting it.  I’ve also turned register-globals off, which might break some pages.  Please tell me if you find any pages that don’t work or don’t validate.</p>
<p>The mIRC section has been removed in favor of a more general programming section, which you’ll notice is “Coming soon!”.  This is something I really hope to get working, because I have a fair amount of code laying around that I plan on releasing under the GPL.  You can use the browse script to look through what’s already uploaded, feel free to download any of it but I make no guarantees that anything will work and I reserve all rights unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>I think that just about covers it for the website.  I uninstalled Ragnarok Online the other day because the lag was getting so horrible, so my soul is free for the moment.  We’ll see if something else manages to catch it.</p>
