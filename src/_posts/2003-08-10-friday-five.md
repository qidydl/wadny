A belated [Friday Five](http://fridayfive.org/ "Five questions to answer in your blog, every friday"){:rel='external'}:

1. <b>What’s the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?</b>\
    Montréal for the 2003 [CS Games](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jwolfs2/csgames/){:rel='external'} at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/){:rel='external'}. Good times, but much colder than Rochester.
2. <b>What’s the most bizarre/unusual thing that’s ever happened to you while traveling?</b>\
    Hmm, that’s a tough one. Probably the time we ran the motorhome off into a ditch trying to get a goofy green bug to go out the window (don’t ask, and no, I wasn’t driving).
3. <b>If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?</b>\
    Hmm… probably something predictable like Hawaii, but [Le Mans](http://www.lemans.org/){:rel='external'} is pretty high up on my list too.
4. <b>Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?</b>\
    I’ve ever actually “travelled” by plane or train (I’ve been in both but never to actually go somewhere) but I think I’d prefer car anyways.
5. <b>What’s the next place on your list to visit?</b>\
    Mosport (see yesterday’s post).
