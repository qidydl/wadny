        <p>Well, it appears ironkite is shutting down and taking all of their hosted sites with them... that means I need a new place to host
           me, and I'm having a hell of a time finding something decent.  All of the free places want ghey banner ads, and I don't exactly have
           a lot of money to blow on hosting... oh well.
	<p>In personal news, I got a sore throat on saturday, so I didn't go to school today... this sucks.

        <p>Welcome to the new qid.nu design.  The previous one had a funky graphical menu, but after finding looroll.com, I got inspired to
           do something with layers.  Originally, I tried making a site with just one HTML page that just turned layers on and off, but it
           didn't work, so I just went to normal pages.
