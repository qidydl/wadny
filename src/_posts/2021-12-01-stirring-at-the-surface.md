title: Stirring at the surface

It may not be the splashiest website resurrection ever (it may even be thoroughly mediocre), but at least things are
back on the air now. I even had a great idea for a real actual post! Then I forgot it. Maybe it will come back to me.

In the meantime, I ditched the over-engineered AWS scheme I had planned and switched to
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/){:rel='external'}, which may not be quite as infrastructure-as-code-y,
but was considerably simpler to set up. I'm not quite sure I like that Cloudflare is building the site now instead of a
GitHub Action, but at least it works.
