<p>My name is David Osolkowski, and this is wadny.com. I’m a third-year software engineering student at <abbr
        title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr>. When I’m not at school, my home is about an hour to the
    west, near Buffalo.</p>
<p>I have a few years of programming experience with C++, Java, PHP, and Python. I’ve done project design with <abbr
        title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr> and Rational Rose, and I am familiar with a few different
    <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>s, including Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Emacs. I
    also have considerable experience with website design, network/Linux administration, and general computer
    administration and maintenance.</p>
<p>I am currently taking courses full-time at RIT, but I will be looking for a job of some sort for the summer, starting
    roughly in June and going to the beginning of September. My <a href="/professional/Resume.pdf">résumé is
        available for download</a> in Adobe PDF format.</p>
<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript"
        onclick="location.href=email(); return false">qid[at]wadny.com</a>, ICQ me at 1605605, contact me on <abbr
        title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</abbr> as “Iron ragtie”, or reach me on <abbr
        title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> at <a href="irc://irc.edgeirc.net/coders"
        title="This link is designed for an IRC client">irc.edgeirc.net #coders</a>. On IRC, my nickname is usually qid,
    and you can leave me a note with Memoserv if I’m not there.</p>

<h1>Desktop customizing</h1>
<p>I’ve been watching the customizing scene for many years now, going back to the days when Windows 98 was as good as it
    got. I used to use Litestep and several other programs to do some rather serious customization work, but nowadays I
    stick to customizing the taskbar with <a href="http://shii.org/tclock" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">TClock2</a> and changing the shell icons using <a
        href="http://www.virtualplastic.net/scrow/iphile.html" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">IconPhile</a>. You can take a look at <a
        href="screenshot.png">my current desktop</a> (or the <a
        href="screenshot-low.png">low-quality version</a>) to see the results.</p>
<p>I have a collection of many different wallpapers that I rotate through. I can’t recall where I found most of them,
    but I have an old <a href="background-sources.txt">list of sources</a> that you can look through. Probably the best
    place for wallpapers nowadays is <a href="http://www.customize.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Customize.org</a>. I especially like the work of <a
        href="http://www.freundt.org/florian/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Really awesome, simple wallpapers">hermik</a> (who <a
        href="http://users.customize.org/hermik" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Hermik’s Customize.org page">is on Customize.org</a>).</p>
<p>A few programs that I like:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Programmer’s Notepad</a> is a
        very nice, open-source text editor</li>
    <li><a href="http://miranda-im.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Miranda</a> is a somewhat quirky
        but very lightweight multi-network instant messenging client</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window">PuTTY</a> is an excellent <abbr title="Secure SHell">SSH</abbr> client
        with a lot of nice features</li>
    <li><a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">FileZilla</a> is an
        <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> client that also supports Secure FTP and file transfer
        over SSH</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.winamp.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Winamp</a> is still the best music
        player ever, but you should get <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=winamp" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window - Old versions of Winamp">version 2.91</a></li>
