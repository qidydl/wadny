title: Unpredictable won’t bother anymore
---
<p>More changes, which may or may not stay: following <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/07/23/redesign-time-presentation/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - 1976design: Redesign explained">Dunstan’s lead</a>, I switched the front page to use “humanized” post times and the time since the post was made.  Archive pages still use the old format.  I haven’t decided which one I prefer, so this may change randomly.  I changed the count of comments and trackbacks to be a single count of “replies,” which should make things simpler.  I added a link to the menu for <a href="/news/latest/">latest replies</a>, which has been around for a while but never linked from anywhere.  I moved <a href="/about/blogroll/">the blogroll</a> to its own page, making room for one of those linklogs that seems to be so popular.  It’s still under construction, so bear with me.</p>
<p>Any comments on the changes?  I could go either way on some of them, so hopefully the four people that read my site will have an opinion.</p>
