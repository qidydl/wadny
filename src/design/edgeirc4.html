    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>EdgeIRC was an Internet Relay Chat network operated by me and several of my friends. It originally went online in
        May of 2000, and had a website shortly thereafter. This is the fourth design I made for the EdgeIRC website, and
        the third that was actually used.</p>

    <h2>Standards</h2>
    <p>Like all of my more modern designs, EdgeIRC version 4 was entirely standards-based, using semantic <abbr
            title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> for markup and <abbr
            title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for layout and design. This resulted in easier development, faster
        redesigns in the future, smaller page sizes, more control over page design, and better accessibility for all
        users.</p>

    <h2>Visual design</h2>
    <p>Visually, version 4 represents a major evolution of the <a href="/design/summary/#edge3">previous design</a>. A
        similar color scheme was chosen to ensure that the new site felt similar to the previous site, but the new
        design is much cleaner than the previous version and appears more open and calm, thanks to extensive use of
        whitespace, particularly in the heading and menu.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>EdgeIRC was written on a simple PHP backend primarily to aid maintenance. Sections could be added, removed, and
        refactored by editing one menu file instead of having to change each page. This backend also allowed the use of a
        MySQL server to store the news along with a form allowing admins to post news from their browser. Pages are set
        up as directories, so the underlying technology is not exposed to the user and can be changed at will without
        impacting links.</p>
