<p>This page contains information about wadny.com itself: a history of the website, going back before it was called
    wadny.com; information on the markup and standards followed; information on the typography used; information on
    software and programming languages used; and rights and various administrivia.</p>

<h1>Site history</h1>
<p>My first work with creating websites was duke3d.com, before I actually knew how to make websites. I recall not being
    able to do a page background because I kept spelling it “backround”. This lasted for a little while, but
    Duke Nukem 3D eventually got old. Next I moved on to the Quake 2 Information Database (QID), which went through
    numerous redesigns before I got ambitious and turned it into the First-Person Shooter Information Database (FPSID).
    Then a website called YDL was added on and redesigned twice to handle the webdesign business I pretended I had and
    the mIRC scripting stuff that I actually did have (which can still be downloaded from here but is horribly out of
    date and undocumented).</p>
<p>Then I got lucky. Out of the kindness of his heart, a friend of mine named Stal gave me free hosting with PHP, an
    <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> database, a subdomain, as much space as I wanted, and no
    transfer limit—an incredibly nice gift. I repayed him by selling him duke3d.com for $20, which was a bargain
    at the time. I started adding some personal stuff to my website, such as my wallpaper collection and some
    experimental designs, and it grew into a hacked-together front end with frames on top of two separate websites
    (FPSID and YDL). It wasn’t exactly easy to work with, and some of it was downright ugly.</p>
<p>Then I heard about the <a href="http://www.threeoh.com/may1/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">May 1st
        Reboot</a> from <a href="https://www.endeffect.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">endeffect</a>
    and decided I needed to reorganize into a single, uniform website instead of a conglomeration of several sites. I
    signed up just in time and got to work on trying to organize everything. Slowly, everything started to pull
    together, and eventually I had a decent site that worked quite well and could easily expand to cover other topics.
    It was all based on PHP so I could add or delete entire sections in a minute or so. The design, although a little
    crude, was much better than what I had before and was pretty clean.</p>
<p>Then everything fell apart. I’m still not sure why, but Stal suddenly couldn’t host my site any more, so
    I started the search for hosting. Eventually, I settled on registering the domain name with <a
        href="https://www.gandi.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Gandi</a>, hosting the <abbr
        title="Domain Name Service">DNS</abbr> with <a href="https://www.dyndns.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">DynDNS</a>, and hosting the website itself on InstantWebsiteDesign (slightly
    misleading name, since they didn’t design any part of my site). That setup worked well for a couple months
    before InstantWebsiteDesign broke their servers, replaced my page with someone else’s, and stopped responding
    to all communication. After cursing at them for a while, I moved to <a href="https://www.phpwebhosting.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">phpwebhosting.com</a>, which has been very stable for a while now.
    There have also been several redesigns of varying magnitude since the first unified page.</p>
<p>TODO: discuss resurrection using Jekyll, need to determine hosting and DNS plans before I know what the actual
    situation will be. </p>

<h1>Code and standards</h1>
<p>Wadny.com is entirely hand-written <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5, <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, all rendered ahead of time using <a
        href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a <a
        href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Basic explanation of static site generators">static site
        generator</a>, which is a tool that renders content using templates and layouts to produce simple HTML files
    that require no special processing to serve. This is much simpler and cheaper to host than a site that runs as a
    program and renders dynamically. The content and styles for all pages should be valid, and the buttons in the
    sidebar can be used to validate any page.</p>
<p>I try to make extensive use of semantic elements, including proper headings, acronyms, code markup, and the like.
    Tables are only used to mark up tabular data. Layout is done entirely with CSS. A standards-compliant browser such
    as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Firefox</a> is highly
    encouraged.</p>
<p>Some info on understanding this site: unvisited links are blue, visited links are red. Any modern CSS-compliant
    browser will show some links will have a little red arrow next to them (<a href="#"
        rel="external">example</a>)—these links point to a url outside of this site, and usually open in a new browser
    window. There are non-external links that open in new windows, and there might be unmarked external links, but the
    arrows should help.</p>

<h1>Typography</h1>
<p>Typography on the web is difficult—there’s no guarantee your readers will have even one of the fonts you
    want to use, and if they’re using <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - The lynx web browser">lynx</a> you might as well not even bother. As such, I have
    kept wadny.com’s typography fairly simple.</p>
<p>The body text should be a simple sans-serif font (probably Verdana on Windows, and Lucida Grande on Macintosh OS X).
    The headings are hopefully Palatino Linotype, which I think is absolutely gorgeous; if you’re unlucky enough
    not to have it, the fallback is Times New Roman (*shudder*) or plain Times (which I believe is a font on some
    Unixes).
    The images in the sidebar may be hand-rendered text; I didn’t make them, so I don’t know.</p>
<p>I have also tried to ensure that all punctuation is correct, by using alternate Unicode characters for quotes,
    dashes, ellipses, and other special characters. The effect is subtle, but I believe it is a worthwhile enhancement.
</p>

<h1>Production</h1>
<p>Virtually everything on this site is hand-made by me (the icons and sidebar link images being notable exceptions). I
    currently use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Visual Studio
        Code</a> for editing text and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window"><abbr
            title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr></a> for editing images. Many of the icons in the header
    are from <a href="https://www.kottke.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Jason Kottke’s weblog</a>.
</p>
<p>The site content is managed in <a href="https://dev.azure.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Azure
        DevOps</a>. Files are stored in a git repository, processed through Jekyll using an automated build pipeline,
    and deployed to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Azure App Service</a> using an automated release pipeline. I’ll have to write a
    blog post explaining this system in more detail. It’s pretty technical to understand and set up the automation, but
    the end result is I can make changes on my desktop (or easily set up an environment on any computer with a couple
    standard tools), and deploy those changes with literally two or three clicks.</p>
