title: Design updates
---
<p>I’ve been doing a bunch of work on the design section recently.  First, I added an introduction page to explain the new organization.  As for the new organization itself, the design section is now split between separate, extended portfolio sites for a handful of my more recent designs and the old big summary page for the rest of my designs.  The summary page has been updated a little and there’s a new design.  The separate portfolio site for wadny.com isn’t finished yet, but hopefully it will be soon.  There are also a couple of other designs I’m hoping to put up later.</p>
<p>I also made a couple other changes to the site design—there are some new links under Recommended, the buttons have been updated, and I changed the line-height for body text, which makes the site considerably more readable (I wish I had discovered that earlier).</p>
