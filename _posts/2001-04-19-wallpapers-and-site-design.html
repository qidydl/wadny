title: Wallpapers and site design

Wow, two posts in a month… lots going on :-)
<p>First off, there’s a bunch of new wallpapers up in the desktop area, see if you can figure out what they are. Maybe I should add dates and sorting to browse.php… nah.</p>
<p>Second, I actually made a new webdesign, it’s at <a href="/design/memheap/" >www.wadny.com/design/memheap/</a>, <del>instead of the designs section, because I’m hoping to actually do something with it. Maybe I will…</del></p>
