<tr><td><p>There's some miscellaneous info you need to know, if you came here first, I congratulate you on being one of those people who has the sense to find out what they need to know first.  Did I say that right?  Never mind.  Here's some stuff to read:
<ul>
<li>Don't take my images.  I spent a total of 2 hours making them, and making them look right, so if you want some nice looking images like mine e-mail <a href="mailto:qid(at)phoenixdsl(dot)com?subject=Images">me</a> or go to <a href="http://www.mixworld.com/" target="_top">www.mixworld.com</a> - he made the images for <a href="http://www.planetquake.com" target="_top">PlanetQuake</a> and <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com" target="_top">PlanetUnreal.</a>
<li>You may use the info on these pages, although I would prefer it if you could reword it for your own site so you aren't just copying.
<li>Some of the images on this site are copyrighted by id software, meaning if you don't have a little message like I have in the Quake2 menu frame, packs of carniverous lawyers have the power to sue the **** out of you (bad word deleted for maintainment of content rating).
<li>Do not change the predefined topics of e-mail messages.  I have filters set up on my e-mail to flag messages with certain topics, change the title and I won't notice your message as easily.
<li>Don't harass or flame me, I have filters for that too (well, most of it).
</ul>
<p>I guess that's it for now.  If I think of anything else I'll put it up.</td>
