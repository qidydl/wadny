title: Menu improvements
---
Ok, a couple more changes to the site. The menu now sends you to `www.wadny.com/sectionname/` instead of `www.wadny.com/index.php?sec=dumbnumber`, which should be much easier to understand and cache better in browsers. Also, I did a bunch of reworking on the browse script so it actually works this way instead of breaking and being ugly and stuff. I’m also working on getting the subdomains set up again, so you’ll actually have all 4 access methods (see [July 22nd 2001 - Section access methods]({% post_url 2001-07-22-section-access-methods %})) working again.
