[Drew](http://www.allinthehead.com/retro/195/ "all in the <head>: Page 23"){:rel='external'} told me to:

1. Grab the nearest book.
2. Open the book to page 23.
3. Find the fifth sentence.
4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.

From a book called <cite>The Nature of the Judicial Process</cite> by Benjamin Cardozo:

> It may not be modified at once, for the attempt to do absolute justice in every single case would make the development and maintenance of general rules impossible; but if a rule continues to work injustice, it will eventually be reformulated.

An interesting experiment in meme propagation, I suppose.
