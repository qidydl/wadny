title: New internet connection
---
About a month ago, Rhythms decided they didn’t feel like providing DSL service in this area, and with the convenient departure of Covad and Northpoint as well, I had no internet access. How convenient.

Right now, I’m stuck using a crappy cable connection from the local cable company, and it’s definitely worse than the DSL I had before. Hopefully, I’ll be able to get on something better in the near future.

P.S.: my old email account from PhoenixDSL (which no longer actually exists) still works. Go figure. If you want to email me, use `qid[at]wadny.com` instead.
