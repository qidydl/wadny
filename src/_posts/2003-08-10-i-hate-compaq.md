Eep! Roommate!

…

And we now return you to the continuing saga of My Crappy Compaq Laptop:\
The trackpad appears to be dying again, but this time it’s being highly intermittent without actually giving me the BIOS error I had before. However, considering I just restored it from the recovery CD anyways, they can’t claim it’s a software problem. Unfortunately, the warranty expires in less than a week, so I’ll have to shell out at least $80 to keep it covered, which sucks. If this damned thing would just *work* it would be a decent laptop. :-|

I wonder if cheese became a funny word after all of the debate over whether it was a funny word that resulted in the decision that it isn’t?
