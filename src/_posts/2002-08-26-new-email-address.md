title: New e-mail address
---
Ok, some relatively important news: my email address has changed. I am now using `qid[at]wadny.com` as my primary email address, since `qid[at]edgeirc.net` is apparently no longer working. Of course, the edgeirc.net address was the reply-to for my primary email account and I was using it for virtually all contact information, so having to switch over is really annoying. I’ve fixed every email link I can find, and also got around to cleaning up some of the older news posts.

I leave for college tomorrow morning. I hope I can get everything ready in time…
