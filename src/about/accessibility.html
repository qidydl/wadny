<p>Wadny.com includes many accessibility features, most of which I learned from Mark Pilgrim on <a
        href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">DiveIntoAccessibility</a>.
    If you have any questions or comments, you can send me an e-mail—information is on <a href="/about/author">the
        author page</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="access-keys">Access keys</h2>
    <p>Many browsers support jumping to links or form elements by using key combinations defined on a website. On
        Windows or Unix/BSD-based systems, the normal key combination is <code>ALT + accesskey</code>; on Macs, the
        usual combination is <code>Control + accesskey</code>. Wadny.com includes the following access keys:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access key “0”: This page</li>
        <li>Access key “1”: Home page</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 id="standards">Standards compliance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All pages on wadny.com should validate as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5. The <abbr
                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> of wadny.com is also validated. Validator links are provided
            in the sidebar to check this—if you find non-validating pages, please tell me.</li>
        <li>Wadny.com is <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/" rel="external"
                title="Opens in a new window - Bobby validator for accessibility">Bobby</a> approved for U.S. Section
            508 and should also be approved for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 1.0, except that the Bobby
            validator incorrectly believes that the <code>onclick</code> event handler is mouse-only—in every browser
            I have tested it with, it works using either a keyboard or mouse. Thus, my site is <abbr
                title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>-compliant, although Bobby does not validate it.
        </li>
        <li>I have attempted to use structured semantic markup and CSS-based aesthetics whenever possible. This means
            all headings should be marked up with <code>&lt;h#&gt;</code> tags, tabular data (and ONLY tabular data) is
            marked up with summarized, captioned tables, and so forth.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 id="navigation">Naviation aids</h2>
    <p>All pages have <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags pointing to the wadny.com home page and the Atom version of my news
        page. These links should already be usable in text-only browsers and screen readers, and they may be exposed in
        other browsers as well.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="links">Links</h2>
    <p>Many links include title attributes to provide further information about the link or to indicate if the link
        opens in a new window. This helps links make sense out of context. Also, there are no <code>javascript:</code>
        pseudo-links, even though some links will open in new windows in browsers that support them. In addition, links
        that open in new windows are indicated by a small red arrow to the left of the link and the phrase “Opens in a
        new window” in the link title.</p>

<section>
    <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
    <p>Wadny.com uses a minimum of images to cut down on download time and improve accessibility. All images used on
        this site have descriptive alt attributes so users of text-only browsers are not prevented from using them. For
        users that are displaying images, there is usually also a title for the image to display as a tooltip.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 id="design">Visual design</h2>
    <p>This site uses CSS for visual layout. When the page is read in a screen reader, it should work properly due to
        the simple and standards-compliant markup; however, this is untested. If you are aware of any issues with my
        site when it is handled by a screen reader, please let me know.</p>

<section>
    <h2 id="summary">Wrap-up</h2>
    <p>This site and its accessibility features are a work in progress. If you would like to suggest changes to make to
        the site or this page, or have comments of any kind, feel free to contact me; information is on <a
            href="/about/author">the author page</a>.</p>
