    <br>First of all, there's a new version of IDTScript out, with a few small updates and an interesting new system.  Also, I finally got around to
        updating the programming section - the C++ page is up, and the PHP page has been edited to be more up-to-date.  There's a sample program in the C++
        section, go check it out (it's DOS-only, though, so NT and ME users might have problems).
    <p><center><b>November 6, 2000 - 10:55pm</b></center>
    <br>I realized there was a ton of stuff in qid.mrc that I've been using that hasn't been put anywhere else, so I cleaned up a new version and put it out
        - give it a look if you'd like some interesting and useful extra functions.
    <p><center><b>October 13, 2000 - 11:25pm</b></center>
    <br>Just a note for anyone looking for help with IDTScript or blink, the support channel is now hosted on irc.edgeirc.net, so don't bother with the old
        network.  Email and everything else is the same.
    <p><center><b>September 22, 2000 - 6:23pm</b></center>
    <br>Well, I completely forgot how to go about releasing IDTScript, and as a result, a bunch of stuff got forgotten or mispacked or whatever.  I added a
        couple small features, mostly theme stuff and distribution/configuration changes to make the script work properly with itself.  I recommend getting
        1.5.2 immediately, especially if you had problems getting previous versions to work.  I'm going to have to see if I can get the scripting sites I
        submitted 1.5.1a to to use this version instead. &nbsp;:-|
    <p><center><b>September 17, 2000 - 1:30pm</b></center>
    <br>I found a bug in IDTScript that prevented you from receiving DCC's - it's been fixed with version 1.5.1a.  All you have to do is replace script.mrc,
        nothing needs to be done to any other files.
    <p><center><b>September 16, 2000 - 10:43pm</b></center>
    <br>I remembered that I needed to make an update on the site, and since I had some stuff to post anyways, I figured I'll try to remember what I deleted.
        Anyways, both blink and idtscript have been updated.  Blink has a small bugfix that prevents people from putting commands in quit messages and
        having them executed when you do a seen.  IDTScript has a lot more, though, including MP3 updates for mIRC 5.8, new theming aliases, help fixes, and
        a new theme that's far better than the old default.  If you use either of those, I highly recommend you get the new versions, and if you've never
        tried IDTScript or gave up on it, you should try it now.
    <p>The other thing besides script updates concerns blink.  As you may have noticed if you run a copy of blink, mIRC does not handle certain things well,
        if it manages to handle them at all (the EAL starts giving stupid "line too long" errors far too quickly - mIRC has serious limitations).  A while
        ago, I tried to write an irc client/port of blink in C++, but it didn't work too well.  Recently, we got a linux computer and I started screwing
        around with perl.  Someone else on Inside3D has a perl bot, and eventually I wound up working on a perl port of blink.  Being the incredibly
        creative (hah) person that I am, it's named "plink".  Right now it has a few basic features and some stuff that you can only really do with perl on
        linux, but I'll eventually get just about everything in there and (hopefully) release it.  If you want to see it or whatever, come to
        irc.inside3d.net #gloom (I'm usually in there as QID|YDL, if not, look for me in #coders).
    <p><center><b>July 24, 2000 - 5:51pm</b></center>
    <br>Well, the site somehow managed to fuck itself up, and I lost the huge update I just made, and I don't feel like rewriting it now.  I'll fix it later.
    <p><center><b>April 19, 2000 - 12:29am</b></center>
    <br>This is sort of the same day, but I don't feel like inventing what to do when I do updates on the same day with this site. Anyways,
        I've updated the <a href="#">samples</a> page with a bunch of new designs and new screenshots of all the old ones, so check it out and
        gasp in awe at my ability to waste huge amounts of time.&nbsp; :-D
    <p><center><b>April 18, 2000 - 11:20pm</b></center>
    <br>I finally managed to get some Javascript functions working that let me pass only the layer name, so the page is now IE-compatible.  Congratulations.
        I don't know why, but IE ignores some of the CSS in my menu (and people say NS sucks for CSS - yeah, riiight) so the text links are really hard to
        see unless you put the cursor over them.
    <p><center><b>March 26, 2000 - 9:20pm</b></center>
    <br>I finally got the programming section started.  Currently, it only has a basic description of PHP, but I'll get the samples section put up as soon
        as I can.  After that, I'll put up the C++ section.  There isn't really much programming I do besides C++ and PHP, but I may come up with some other
        stuff to add later on.
    <p><center><b>March 7, 2000 - 7:55pm</b></center>
    <br>Well, for some unknown reason, the menu for this page refuses to work in IE.  I've tried a ton of different ways to reference layers, most of which
        work fine in Netscape, and none of which work in IE.&nbsp; &gt;:-| &nbsp;So, if you're using IE, you're basically screwed unless you can show me how
        to change the visibility and positioning of a layer with IE.
    <p><center><b>March 1, 2000 - 10:06pm</b></center>
    <br>I remembered the IRC Development Team Addons page, and added that to the mIRC menu.  The site is currently fully converted, and the design is being
        uploaded.  As soon as that's finished, it will officially replace the old YDL design.  So, without further ado, welcome to the new YDL!
    <p><center><b>March 1, 2000 - 4:54pm</b></center>
    <br>I got the webdesign menu item in place, I'm porting the last pages of the old YDL design over now.  Note that the "packages" page will disappear -
        I'm going to charge based on time &amp; effort, although I don't have a specific amount or rate yet.
    <p><center><b>February 29, 2000 - 7:43pm</b></center>
    <br>Welcome to the all-new YDL Development website.  I'm still converting stuff over - website design stuff doesn't exist yet, and blink isn't here
        either.  However, there's a lot of change along with this redesign.  The main difference: YDL Webdesign and the IRC Development Team no longer exist;
        everything's been merged into a single company.  Assuming this ever becomes an actual company, that should save me a ton of hassle.  Also, I can
        broaden my horizons - previously, all I had set up was stuff for website design and scripting for IRC.  If I decided to make a standalone program of
        some sort, it didn't fall into any of the existing companies.  Now, however, all I have to do is add a menu item.&nbsp; :-D &nbsp;Anyways, there's a
        bunch of stuff on the <a href="about.html">about</a> page, explaining everything, so take a look there.
