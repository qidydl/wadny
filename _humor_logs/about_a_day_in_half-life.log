[22:15] <QID|YDL> we have a spare 4.3gig HD laying around, so we're gonna hook up the printer to the pass-through port on the scanner and put the scanner on the motherboard's parallel port
[22:16] <QID|YDL> then we can get rid of the second parallel port adapter card and open up the shared pci/isa slot
[22:16] <QID|YDL> we can put something on the ide card we got and then install linux on the 4.3gig HD
