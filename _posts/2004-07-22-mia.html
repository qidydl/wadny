<p>Several weblogs seem to have suddenly disappeard. <a href="http://www.erisfree.com/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Eris Free</a>, <a href="http://www.jeffcroft.com/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Jeff Croft</a>, and <a href="http://www.make-believe.org/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">Make Believe</a> are all gone—Eris and Make Believe appear to have been suspended,
    and Jeff’s site simply doesn’t load. One site at once is an accident, two sites at once is a coincidence, but three
    sites? All, as far as I can tell, hosted completely independently? This is a little unusual. Does anyone know Eris,
    Jeff, or <del>um, the guy that runs make-believe (sorry, I can’t remember his name)</del><ins>Joseph</ins> and know
    what’s going on? If they need new hosting, I would recommend <a href="http://www.r1hosting.com/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window">R1Hosting</a>, because I know the guy who runs it and I know that he knows what
    he’s doing. Hopefully this is just a temporary problem, and it will get resolved soon.</p>

        Looks like Jeff Croft is back, but Eris and Make-Believe are still missing.</ins></p>

        Make-Believe is back now as well. It is, of course, written by Joseph Pearson, which I could have known by
        looking at <em>my own blogroll</em>. Oops. Sorry, Joseph.</ins></p>

        Eris has returned as well, so everything’s back to normal.</ins></p>
