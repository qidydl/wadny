title: Summer update
---
Dangit, now that shinji got his [website](http://www.rapidhate.org/ "shinji's goofy little weblog"){:rel='external'} hosted on [r1hosting](http://www.r1hosting.com/ "Hosting by R1CH - highly recommended"){:rel='external'}, he’s making my update schedule look positively lethargic. Perhaps if more happened in my life I would post more, but, eh…

Last night was the annual [SCCA](http://www.scca.org/ "Sports Car Club of America"){:rel='external'} picnic here in the [Western NY region](http://www.wny-scca.com/ "Western New York region Sports Car Club of America"){:rel='external'}. Good food, got to hang around with a bunch of cool people. Oh, and I got a ride in a brand-new M3. :-D Such a kick-ass car… if only I could afford one.

Something else that’s sort of cool: I am now the proud owner of possibly the only Nerf [Sharpshooter II]({% link pictures/20030807/Sharpshooter II.jpg %} "Picture of my Nerf Sharpshooter II") with a custom-fabricated [aluminum pull ring]({% link pictures/20030807/Sharpshooter II pull ring.jpg %} "Picture of the aluminum pull ring") (or aluminium for the Brits). I think it looks pretty nice, and at least I can use it again.

The biggest event since my last post, I got one of my wisdom teeth out. My god, that was an unpleasant experience. The surgery itself was disgusting enough to still make me feel sick to my stomach when I recall it, but fortunately not horrifically painful. The recovery was more annoying, having to chew on one side of my mouth for a week and deal with the pain, which was rather annoying at times. Realistically, though, it was easy to get through, and it’s been about a month and I’m back to normal now.

What else happened since my last update that’s worth knowing? Not a whole lot… spent a couple days helping my dad with roofing work on the house, that was highly not fun. Got an air conditioner and returned it because it sucked. Got a new [Klipsch Promedia 2.1](http://www.klipsch.com/product/product.aspx?cid=103){:rel='external'} speaker system, a HUGE improvement over the intermittent and wimpy Boston Acoustics system I had before. Installed Linux on my laptop and discovered my wireless card is virtually unsupported, I’ll try putting Win2K on there next. I’ll post more as I remember.

What’s coming up in the future? In a couple weeks the parents and I pack up the motorhome and head north for the [American Le Mans Series](http://www.americanlemans.com/){:rel='external'} Grand Prix at [Mosport](http://www.mosport.com/2003/alms.htm){:rel='external'}, which will hopefully have better weather than the yucky rain we got last year. I head back to [RIT](http://www.rit.edu/ "Rochester Institute of Technology"){:rel='external'} on September 5, I’m actually looking forward to that.

Ok, I’ll leave it at that for now.
