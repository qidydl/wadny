title: It’s evolution

Obviously, the site has changed again.  The design changes should be obvious; I thought the site could use some more color and style, since it was pretty plain before.  I also made some small code changes, the most noticeable being that I changed “Archives home” in the archive pages to a link to go up a level in the archives.  Let me know what you think.
