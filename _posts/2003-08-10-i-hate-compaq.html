Eep!  Roommate!
<p>…</p>
<p>And we now return you to the continuing saga of My Crappy Compaq Laptop:
<br />The trackpad appears to be dying again, but this time it’s being highly intermittent without actually giving me the <acronym title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</acronym> error I had before.  However, considering I just restored it from the recovery CD anyways, they can’t claim it’s a software problem.  Unfortunately, the warranty expires in less than a week, so I’ll have to shell out at least $80 to keep it covered, which sucks.  If this damned thing would just WORK it would be a decent laptop.  :-|</p>
<p>I wonder if cheese became a funny word after all of the debate over whether it was a funny word that resulted in the decision that it isn’t?</p>
