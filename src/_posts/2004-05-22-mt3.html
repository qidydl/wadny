<p>I <a href="/news/during/2004/01/13/" title="January 13, 2004: Spam is evil.">mentioned before</a> some of the benefits
    of having written my own weblogging system, and now I can add another one: the MovableType 3.0 fiasco. There seems
    to be a <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/05/14/never-kick-a-sleeping-giant/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Burningbird: Never Kick a Sleeping Giant">growing hostility</a> towards Six Apart
    and their poor handling of the <abbr title="MovableType">MT</abbr>3 release, particularly related to the new
    licensing scheme they made up. As a result, many people using MovableType are considering moving to another system.
    As <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - dive into mark - Freedom 0">Mark Pilgrim explained</a>, non-Free software is
    always riskier than Free software, no matter how much you trust the developers.</p>
<p>So, where do I come in? The answer is, I don’t, and that’s the nice part. I don’t have to worry about my weblog
    system suddenly costing money for upgrades, because I make my own weblogging system. What would I have to do, pay
    myself? MovableType is a nice system—I’ve tried it a bit myself—but it’s much easier just having my own system that
    always does exactly what I want it to.</p>
