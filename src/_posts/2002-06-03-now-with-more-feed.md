title: Now with more feed
---
I just added an interesting new feature to wadny.com—an RSS feed for the news page. I doubt it’ll get much use, since you’d have to be really interested in my news page and know what an RSS feed is to make any use of it, but I think it’s a good idea to have the system in place should I ever start updating this page more often or expand my user base. Anyways, it’s there if you want it.

Also, I added a print media stylesheet to my ever-growing collection of metadata tags, so if you print out my site in a standards-compliant browser, you’ll get a nicer-looking version with less clutter and visible link URLs and all kinds of cool stuff.
