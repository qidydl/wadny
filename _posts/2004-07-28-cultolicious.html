        title="Opens in a new window - Photo Matt: A Foot of Mac">joined the cult of the Mac</a>. I’ve considered doing
    this before, but it’s hard to justify the expense of a PowerBook—or even an iBook—when I already have a perfectly
    usable laptop. Also, I’ve heard many nasty things about problems with Apple’s hardware and tech support, plus the
    whole shamozzle surrounding Konfabulator/Dashboard, plus the whole scary cult thing. I’m no Windows advocate, but XP
    Pro seems pretty stable, and <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2003/10/16/its-all-about-the-bling-bling/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Binary Bonsai: It’s all about the Bling Bling">you can hack it</a>
    to make it look <a href="http://www.aquaxp.com/theme/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - AquaXP">almost
        exactly like OS X</a> if you want.</p>
<p>Even so, I’d still want a Mac laptop except for one stupid, little thing: they only have one mouse button. If a
    computer doesn’t have two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel, I can’t use it. Command-click is not a right mouse
    button. Click and drag is not a scroll wheel. The arrow keys are not a scroll wheel. I know, this is absolutely the
    oldest and possibly dumbest reason people give for not using a Mac, but you can’t just replace the mouse on a
    laptop, and a mouse without a scroll wheel is like a keyboard without a space bar. I can handle Mac OS X and find
    hacks to make it work how I want, but I can’t change the hardware, so I’ll stick with my current laptop for now.</p>
<p>While I’m on the topic of computer hardware, I’m considering replacing my old <a

        title="Opens in a new window">Samsung SyncMaster 950p</a> monitor with a new <abbr
        title="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</abbr> or <abbr title="Liquid Crystal Display">LCD</abbr>. The problem is,
    I happen to be a fairly avid computer gamer, and I play first-person shooters a fair amount. These games depend on
    the ability to react quickly to what you see, and to do that you need a very responsive monitor that doesn’t have
    smearing issues, which rules out all but the most expensive LCDs, and I can’t really afford the models that are left
    over. However, instead of dropping a lot of money on <a

        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Dell 2001FP 20-inch LCD">a high-end LCD</a>, I could spend a lot
    less on <a

        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - NEC MultiSync FE2111SB 22-inch CRT">an even higher-end CRT</a>
    which would be a better monitor and would definitely not suffer from the quirks of an LCD, but it would take up a
    huge amount of desk space, be difficult to transport, and be very heavy. Does anyone know of an LCD under $500 that
    is a 4:3 aspect ratio (remember, <a href="/news/during/2004/07/27/an-issue-needing-resolution"
        title="An Issue Needing Resolution">5:4 ratio is bad</a>), does at least 1280x960 resolution, and can handle a
    modern shooter like Unreal Tournament 2004? If not, it looks like I’ll be looking for someone with a forklift to
    borrow.</p>
