title: New computer hardware
---
I made a few updates to the YDL pages today, there’s new stuff on the programming pages and a new IDTScript version.

On the computer front, my Sound Blaster Live! Platinum came in a few days ago and it’s working great. No lockups in games, fullscreen winamp vis, etc.

Also, I bought an optical Logitech MouseMan Wheel, and it’s working pretty well. I’m not sure what to do with the thumb button though…
