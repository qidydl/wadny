title: Busy, busy, busy

So, obviously it’s been a while since my last post. RIT runs on a quarter system (as opposed to a semester system), so we just had exams and a break. I was too busy during exams to post, and nothing really worth mentioning on here happened during break.

So, that brings us to today—I just updated the design section with a new design (EdgeIRC version 4) and redid all of the thumbnails so you can see the design better. Jakob Nielsen calls this “[Relevance-Enhanced Image Reduction](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9611.html "Marginalia of Web Design (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox November 1996)"){:rel='external'};” Jakob Nielsen also uses big words for no apparent reason. I’d just call it “cropping and resizing,” but maybe that’s why I’m not a so-called “usability expert,” making a bajillion dollars, with a website that looks like it was made by a third-grader.

As long as we’re on the subject of Generally Not-Good Things, Lockergnome has just done [the dumbest thing ever](http://channels.lockergnome.com/web/backissues/20040303.phtml#20040303_1 "Lockergnome GNOMEREPORT: Busy Bees In The Hive"){:rel='external'}: after turning an ugly, old, table-based hack design into a clean, decent-looking standards- and CSS-based design, they (for some unfathomable reason) switched back. This is a slap in the face to countless people who have worked so hard to bring the web out of the tangled mess of nonstandard markup, and it ensures that I will never visit Lockergnome’s site and never believe anything they say again. Simon Willison [sums it up perfectly](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/03/08/devolution "Simon Willison - Lockergnome reverts"){:rel='external'}: <q cite="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/03/08/devolution">Welcome back to 1996.</q>
