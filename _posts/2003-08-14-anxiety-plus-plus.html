Well.  Isn’t this just fucking wonderful?
<p>I leave tomorrow for Mosport (see previous posts) and haven’t even managed to start packing yet.  We’ll undoubtedly leave several hours late, get there in the middle of the night, and not have nearly as much fun as we thought we would.</p>
<p>RIT is still down, thus one of the main <a href="http://www.edgeirc.net/" rel="external">EdgeIRC</a> servers is offline.</p>
<p>The video card in my desktop suddenly seems to be dying, thus rendering it unusable until we can call Alienware, which won’t be until at least Monday.</p>
<p>My laptop hasn’t been packed up yet and the warranty expires in a day or two and if we don’t renew it before it expires we can’t get it covered anymore and we have to pay out the ass to get it fixed.</p>
<p>Today has been an absolute living hell.  I need to go kill something.</p>
