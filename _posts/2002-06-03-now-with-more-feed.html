title: Now with more feed
---
<p>I just added an interesting new feature to wadny.com—an <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> <a
        href="/news/wadny-rss.xml">feed</a> for the news page. I doubt it’ll get much use, since you’d have to be really
    interested in my news page and know what an RSS feed is to make any use of it, but I think it’s a good idea to have
    the system in place should I ever start updating this page more often or expand my user base. Anyways, it’s there if
    you want it.</p>
<p>Also, I added a print media stylesheet to my ever-growing collection of metadata tags, so if you print out my site in
    a standards-compliant browser, you’ll get a nicer-looking version with less clutter and visible link URLs and all
    kinds of cool stuff.</p>
