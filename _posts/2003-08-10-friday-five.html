<div><ol>
<li><b>What’s the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?</b>
<br />Montr�al for the 2003 <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jwolfs2/csgames/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">CS Games</a> at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">McGill University</a>.  Good times, but much colder than Rochester.</li>
<li><b>What’s the most bizarre/unusual thing that’s ever happened to you while traveling?</b>
<br />Hmm, that’s a tough one.  Probably the time we ran the motorhome off into a ditch trying to get a goofy green bug to go out the window (don’t ask, and no, I wasn’t driving).</li>
<li><b>If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?</b>
<br />Hmm… probably something predictable like Hawaii, but <a href="http://www.lemans.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Le Mans</a> is pretty high up on my list too.</li>
<li><b>Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?</b>
<br />I’ve ever actaully “travelled” by plane or train (I’ve been in both but never to actually go somewhere) but I think I’d prefer car anyways.</li>
<li><b>What’s the next place on your list to visit?</b>
<br />Mosport (see the post from August 7th).</li>
