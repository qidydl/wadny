I took the AP U.S. History exam today… it wasn’t too hard, but it took forever to write all the essays. The Cornell trip was largely uneventful. It’s way too hilly. Oh well… I’ve still got this stupid health project on pollution, but I think I can rip most of the report off of britannica.com (good reference for school stuff).

Powerlink decided that they didn’t feel like using the real DHCP standard and instead support Microsoft’s broken version, so they disconnected us without giving us enough time to reconfigure the Linux box. Obviously it’s working again, but I’m beginning to really despise them.

Serious Sam is a kick-ass game if you like shooting lots of weird mutant things.
