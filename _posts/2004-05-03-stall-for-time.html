<p>So, I’m hideously busy with projects right now.  Classes end in two weeks, so I should be able to make some posts after that.  Upcoming news: my summer job, the continuation of the Great Laptop Saga of Compaq-Hating, maybe a technical article, and whatever else I think up between now and then.</p>
<p>I now return you to my regularly scheduled lack of posting…</p>
