title: New e-mail address
---
<p>Ok, some relatively important news: my email address has changed. I am now using <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com"
        title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript"
        onclick="location.href=email(); return false">qid[at]wadny.com</a> as my primary email address, since
    qid[at]edgeirc.net is apparently no longer working. Of course, the edgeirc.net address was the reply-to for my
    primary email account and I was using it for virtually all contact information, so having to switch over is really
    annoying. I’ve fixed every email link I can find, and also got around to cleaning up some of the older news posts.</p>
<p>I leave for college tomorrow morning. I hope I can get everything ready in time…</p>
