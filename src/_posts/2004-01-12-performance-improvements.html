title: Performance improvements
---
<p>I made a few small changes and rewrote the calendar rendering to cut page rendering time by about 0.05s. The old
    calendar system made an SQL SELECT for every day in the calendar; the new system makes just one at the start to get
    all the days that have news posts on them. Between all of the changes I made, page rendering has gone from an
    average of 0.085 seconds to an average of 0.035 seconds, while using a bit less memory. This should make my hosting
    provider happier. A system to rebuild a set of static HTML pages would reduce load even more, but that’s a bit too
    complicated for me to handle myself. I’ll probably try to trim the site down even more before I add the quicklinks
    system, since that will add another SQL select. Aside from quicklinks, I also plan on adding a Help or About page
    for the news section, explaining everything it does, along with a couple more small features. However, the news
    section is now mostly finished.</p>
