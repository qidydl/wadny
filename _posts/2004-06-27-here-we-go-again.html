Attention FastCompany: you do not own the Internet.  <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/about/contact.html" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - FastCompany Contacts and Customer Service">Stop deluding yourselves</a>.  Oh, and someone needs to tell <a href="http://www.sellotape.co.uk/copyright.htm" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Sellotape Copyright Information">Sellotape</a> too, before they make idiots out of themselves (whoops, too late, they’ve been BoingBoinged).  I happen to take the opposite belief that BoingBoing does: they think <q cite="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/26/fastcompanys_terribl.html">FC’s credibity as an authority on the Web lends credence to this bizarre and damaging idea of needing permission to link,</q> whereas I think it simply makes FC look like a bunch of idiots, and guarantees I will never believe anything they say without solid proof and peer approval.  Good work FC, you’ve just ruined your reputation.
