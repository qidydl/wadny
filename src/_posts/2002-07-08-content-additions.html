<p>Added some more site stuff today. There’s a new humor article if you want some light reading, and I added <abbr
        title="First Person Shooter Information Database">FPSID</abbr> (the major predecessor to this site) to the
    design section. I’ve also been cleaning up things here and there, moving stuff around, pruning code… general
    maintenance stuff. Just a reminder, you’re welcome to try and break my code, just let me know if you find anything,
    either with an <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript"
        onclick="location.href=email(); return false">email</a> or a comment.</p>
