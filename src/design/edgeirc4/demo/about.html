<h3>about EdgeIRC</h3>
<p>EdgeIRC is a privately owned and operated IRC network focused on computing and computer gaming.  It is a rather small network, averaging about 150 users
   and 80 channels, but with a solid core user base and a fair number of servers.  Although some of the users can be immature at times, the network has few
   problems and opers rarely have to take action.</p>
<h3>the history of EdgeIRC</h3>
<p>Founded in May of 2000 by qid and Cyber_Ass, EdgeIRC was originally formed as a home for #gloom, the IRC channel for a Quake II multiplayer mod.  It has
   since gained (and lost) many servers, and increased in size quite a bit.  At one point, EdgeIRC was going to become the official IRC network for the Edge
   Gaming Network, but they have since moved to GamesNET.  Our only real problem to date was a <abbr title="Distributed Denial of Service">DDoS</abbr>
   attack that never really hurt any of the servers but did scare off some users.</p>
<h3>the future of EdgeIRC</h3>
<p>EdgeIRC is fairly stable at this point, but also becoming stagnant.  We would be happy to gain more users or servers, or link with other networks, but we
   do not want to give up our domain and the name we have established.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are beginning development on our own IRC daemon.  Cyclone has worked well for us for many years now, but it is lacking features we would
   like, and developing our own daemon should be a worthwile exercise.  We intend to release the daemon under the GPL license, and welcome any assistance in
   developing or testing.  The development channel is #edgeircd if you want to stop by.</p>
