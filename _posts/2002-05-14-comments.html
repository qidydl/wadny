title: Comments!

Sweet, the comments system is up and running!  You can now add comments to any news story you see here and view any comments that other people have added.  There probably won’t be a whole lot, since this site doesn’t get a lot of traffic, but I still think it’s a nice feature.  If you find any bugs, please <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript" onclick="location.href=email(); return false">tell me</a> so I can fix them.  I’ll get the other sections uploaded fairly soon.
