title: I hate Alienware

Current computer status:  laptop is fine.  Brewmeister/risotto is fine.  My desktop is acting as if it’s fine, but I don’t know whether it’s actually working properly or just waiting to break again.  With my luck, it’ll probably work until I move back to <acronym title="Rochester Instutute of Technology">RIT</acronym>, then suddenly die a horrible death.  Who knows?
<p>Oh, that’s right, you all missed the adventures with my desktop.  Instead of a Radeon 9600 Pro, I got an NVidia GeForce FX 5600 Ultra and there’s nothing I can do to get the card I actually wanted.  Also, my desktop has been experiencing some highly intermittent, very nasty problems that seem to be hardware-related but I have no clue what’s actually wrong.  I’m just keeping my fingers crossed for now.</p>
