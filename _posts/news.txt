1	2000-09-06 19:52:50	First post!	This is the first test of the new news posting system. I hope this thing works correctly. &nbsp; :-D
2	2000-09-06 20:00:33	Second post!	Well, I got this news script working correctly, so check in here every once in a while to get news. Don&#8217;t try to add or delete posts, it requires a password which you can&#8217;t get even with a copy of the script because it&#8217;s encrypted. Nyah.\n<p>The <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/about/desktop/\\">desktop section</a> was updated today with two new wallpapers and where you can get them. Some of those are really good, you should download them.</p>
3	2000-09-07 13:19:11	From school	Hi. This is me at school. We have a T1 here, but it&#8217;s slower than my <acronym title=\\"Digital Subscriber Line\\">DSL</acronym> at home (I can almost hear you modem people bitching, but if it makes you feel any better, we seem to have random router troubles). Whee.
4	2000-09-08 17:27:48	Wallpaper added	I added a new wallpaper to the desktop section, &#8220;kult design&#8221; by shinter. He kicks ass.
5	2000-09-10 14:53:11	Slight redesign	I&#8217;ve redesigned the page again. This time, I put the menu on the side so it doesn&#8217;t interfere with YDL&#8217;s design. I&#8217;m going to remove all of the frame-killing code in <acronym title=\\"First-Person Shooter Information Database\\">FPSID</acronym> so it can open in the frames as well, and then everything should work. You&#8217;ll notice the menu also gives the date of the last news post. When I make changes, I&#8217;ll update the news, so check that date.
6	2000-09-10 15:06:53	&#8220;Reset&#8221; link added to start portal	Oh, I also added a link to the start page to reset the positions of the layers. You have to reload for it to take effect. I added it in case you had something in a place that&#8217;s now covered by the menu frame.
7	2000-09-16 23:04:57	New version of blink and IDTScript	YDL Development has been updated with new versions of blink and IDTScript, plus some news on the future of blink.
8	2000-09-17 13:49:08	IDTScript bugfix	I found a bug in IDTScript that disabled <acronym title=\\"Direct Client Connection\\">DCC</acronym>&#8217;s, so that&#8217;s been fixed and a new version is up. Go check it out.
9	2000-09-22 18:37:10	IDTScript 1.5.2 released	I screwed up the previous release of IDTScript, 1.5.2 has now been released with a bunch of distribution fixes, some theming improvements, and a few documentation changes. Not much scripting, but important nonetheless.
10	2000-09-23 16:42:17	FPSID update	I&#8217;ve made an update to <acronym title=\\"First-Person Shooter Information Database\\">FPSID</acronym>. There&#8217;s two new <acronym title=\\"Internet Relay Chat\\">IRC</acronym> logs and a new humor article. Have fun.
11	2000-09-29 16:41:00	Wallpapers and news changes	I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve been mentioning this every time, but I&#8217;ve been throwing up various new wallpapers in the <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/about/desktop/\\">desktop+wallpaper</a> section. I might be going through them at some point and weeding out ones that aren&#8217;t quite as good anymore.\n<p>You&#8217;ll also notice a few changes in the news page, mainly an &#8216;edit&#8217; button at the bottom. I did some screwing around with the news script and made it a little better, and also added the option for me to edit existing posts. I&#8217;m considering making a release of this, but it&#8217;s pretty complex&#8230;</p>\n<p>I also added a few new random titles and removed a couple old ones, so keep your eye out for those.</p>\n<p><acronym title=\\"By The Way\\">BTW</acronym>, from now on, multiple posts in one day will probably be edited together like this, instead of posted separately.</p>
12	2000-09-30 12:00:27	New (sucky) mouse	There&#8217;s some more humor stuff on <acronym title=\\"First-Person Shooter Information Database\\">FPSID</acronym>, go check it out.\n<p>I just got some kind of optical intellimouse, since my old normal logitech wheelmouse was getting worn out. I wish I had done some more research or something, this one doesn&#8217;t work as well as I&#8217;d hoped. The scroll wheel doesn&#8217;t work in all applications and sometimes it either scrolls too much or too little and the software doesn&#8217;t change it&#8230; ugh&#8230; maybe I can return it.  :-|</p>
13	2000-10-13 23:27:44	IRC network relocation	The support channel for IDTScript and blink has moved to irc.edgeirc.net. Feel free to stop on by if you need some help or just want to chat.
14	2001-01-09 13:40:36	New computer	I recently upgraded my computer with a bunch of new stuff:\n<ul>\n<li>900mhz AMD Thunderbird</li>\n<li>ASUS K7V mobo</li>\n<li>256mb PC133 ram</li>\n<li>ATI Radeon 32mb <acronym title=\\"Double Data Rate (Memory)\\">DDR</acronym></li>\n<li>new case w/300watt power supply (drive rails, aww yeah)</li>\n<li>Sound Blaster Live! Platinum (on order)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ph33r.</p>
15	2000-11-06 23:04:37	New qid.mrc	A new version of qid.mrc has been released on the YDL pages&#8212;this script hasn&#8217;t been updated much, so there&#8217;s a ton of addons, many of which are very useful. Make sure to check it out, especially if you have IDTScript.
16	2001-01-18 21:19:17	New computer hardware	I made a few updates to the YDL pages today, there&#8217;s new stuff on the programming pages and a new IDTScript version.\n<p>On the computer front, my <acronym title=\\"Sound Blaster\\">SB</acronym>Live! Platinum came in a few days ago and it&#8217;s working great. No lockups in games, fullscreen winamp vis, etc.</p>\n<p>Also, I bought an optical Logitech MouseMan Wheel, and it&#8217;s working pretty well. I&#8217;m not sure what to do with the thumb button though&#8230;</p>
17	2001-03-29 19:05:08	New internet connection	About a month ago, Rhythms decided they didn&#8217;t feel like providing <acronym title=\\"Digital Subscriber Line\\">DSL</acronym> service in this area, and with the convenient departure of Covad and Northpoint as well, I had no internet access. How convenient.\n<p>Right now, I&#8217;m stuck using a crappy cable connection from the local cable company, and it&#8217;s definitely worse than the DSL I had before. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to get on something better in the near future.</p>\n<p>P.S.: my old email account from PhoenixDSL (which no longer actually exists) still works. Go figure. If you want to email me, use <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">qid[at]wadny.com</a> instead.</p>
18	2001-04-14 16:11:50	Back on the air	After a bunch of downtime, the site seems to be working fine now&#8230; no idea what happened, but oh well.\n<p>I finally got around to putting up a current screenshot, go check it out if you like that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>The old phoenixdsl address is dead now, but I got an address from powerlink&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure if it really works, but you&#8217;re welcome to try. Just use the edgeirc alias, I&#8217;ll change it if we switch <acronym title=\\"Internet Service Provider\\">ISP</acronym>&#8217;s again.</p>
19	2001-04-19 17:27:14	Wallpapers and site design	Wow, two posts in a month&#8230; lots going on :-)\n<p>First off, there&#8217;s a bunch of new wallpapers up in the desktop area, see if you can figure out what they are. Maybe I should add dates and sorting to browse.php&#8230; nah.</p>\n<p>Second, I actually made a new webdesign, it&#8217;s at <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/design/memheap/\\" >www.wadny.com/design/memheap/</a>, <del>instead of the designs section, because I&#8217;m hoping to actually do something with it. Maybe I will&#8230;</del></p>
20	2001-05-01 17:47:56	May 1<sup>st</sup> redesign	Wow, this is getting so much better&#8230; welcome to the May 1st redesign of qid.stals.com! Not everything&#8217;s working right yet, but what does work is much nicer than the sprawling mess I had before. If you can&#8217;t find something, go to Browse and hunt around a bit&#8212;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything missing that isn&#8217;t somewhere else. I&#8217;ve got a bunch of school stuff going on right now (<acronym title=\\"Advanced Placement\\">AP</acronym> exam, project for health, trip to Cornell University this weekend) but I&#8217;ll try to put in some work on everything over the next couple weeks. Don&#8217;t worry, when this is done, the site will be a lot better than what it was before.
21	2001-05-11 22:20:15	AP exam	I took the <acronym title=\\"Advanced Placement\\">AP</acronym> U.S. History exam today&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t too hard, but it took forever to write all the essays. The Cornell trip was largely uneventful. It&#8217;s way too hilly. Oh well&#8230; I&#8217;ve still got this stupid health project on pollution, but I think I can rip most of the report off of britannica.com (good reference for school stuff).\n<p>Powerlink decided that they didn&#8217;t feel like using the real <acronym title=\\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\\">DHCP</acronym> standard and instead support Microsoft&#8217;s broken version, so they disconnected us without giving us enough time to reconfigure the Linux box. Obviously it&#8217;s working again, but I&#8217;m beginning to really despise them.</p>\n<p>Serious Sam is a kickass game if you like shooting lots of weird mutant things.</p>
22	2001-05-24 19:33:32	More wallpapers	I threw up a few more wallpapers recently, if you want some more choices for your desktop you can go download them as usual.\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been doing work on the rewrite of IDTScript, it might get done sometime this year. :-D</p>
23	2001-07-19 17:24:17	Still recovering	The old news database files are saved, but I need a way to convert them into plaintext or somehow get them into this server, so the news will be missing for a while. Sorry.
24	2001-07-21 17:16:56	Random changes	I made a bunch of backend changes that should make errors much nicer-looking (for example, the error when you click on a menu item that I haven&#8217;t had time to fill in yet). I also got most of the Band section filled in, but please don&#8217;t tell everyone to download the mp3&#8217;s from here&#8212;email them, ICQ them, set up a mirror, put them on Napster, whatever.\n<p>If, for some strange reason, you have a burning desire for a wadny.com email address, you can <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">ask me</a> for one. There&#8217;s no real space limit, but I&#8217;ll probably prune anything more than a month old and boot anyone using more than 10 or 15mb (you shouldn&#8217;t be sending or receiving anything that big anyways).</p>
25	2001-07-22 21:45:05	Section access methods	For reasons not entirely understood, even by myself, I pretty much rewrote most of the backend again. Basically, you can access any page in one of 4 ways:\n<ol>\n<li>The menu entry at the top of the page</li>\n<li>www.wadny.com/&lt;section name&gt;</li>\n<li>www.wadny.com/&lt;section name&gt;/form.php</li>\n<li>&lt;section name&gt;.wadny.com &#8211; this only works for sections that I&#8217;ve got something for, so try the menu first</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just replace &lt;section name&gt; with the lowercase name of a menu item and you can use any of those methods. Please <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">tell me</a> if one of the methods screws something up (unless it&#8217;s method 4 and you can&#8217;t resolve the domain, since that would be your fault for not following instructions). I&#8217;ll probably get the design section working next. Form and Gaming are harder, and start might be removed unless I get some neat ideas for what to do with it.</p>
26	2002-05-13 21:47:10	Wadny II: The Return of Wadny	Holy crap, I&#8217;m finally back!  After god knows how long of being down, wadny.com is back on the air with new hosting&#8212;and, you may have noticed, a bunch of other changes.\n<p>First off, the site now uses valid <acronym title=\\"eXtensible HyperText Markup Language\\">XHTML</acronym> 1.0 and <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym> 2 for all of its pages, with cute little &lt;div&gt; tags instead of those clunky old tables.</p>\n<p>Second, I played around with the stylesheets a bit and added colored form boxes, some slight link changes, and these awesome little &#8220;external link&#8221; icons that animate when you mouseover the link.  To see an example of those, click on the &#8220;help!&#8221; link in the upper right of the page&#8212;another new feature.  This page gives some quick info to help you navigate the site, although it does open in a javascript popup.</p>\n<p>The other major feature being added&#8212;it&#8217;s not done yet&#8212;is a brand-new comments system for the news.  I&#8217;m hoping to make the news page a little more like the ubiquitous blog (although how many blogs contain the word &#8220;ubiquitous?&#8221;), so I thought feedback would be a good idea.  When it&#8217;s finished, you&#8217;ll be able to comment on any news story, even the old ones.</p>\n<p>One last note&#8212;I&#8217;m still getting everything working, so some sections aren&#8217;t uploaded yet (currently design, forum, gaming, humor, mirc, and webcam are empty) and some options&#8212;like the &lt;section name&gt;.wadny.com access method&#8212;aren&#8217;t working yet.  Hopefully by next weekend I&#8217;ll have some time to get these running.  I&#8217;m finally back!</p>
27	2002-05-14 16:30:08	Comments!	Sweet, the comments system is up and running!  You can now add comments to any news story you see here and view any comments that other people have added.  There probably won&#8217;t be a whole lot, since this site doesn&#8217;t get a lot of traffic, but I still think it&#8217;s a nice feature.  If you find any bugs, please <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">tell me</a> so I can fix them.  I&#8217;ll get the other sections uploaded fairly soon.\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2002-05-14T21:38:00-05:00\\">Update at 9:38pm: I think I&#8217;ve got all of the old stuff I used to have uploaded, so the site should be pretty much back to normal.  I hope.</ins></p>
33	2002-05-26 00:11:49	Some content additions	I just added a new humor article (there&#8217;s one or two others left to go), added &#8220;Blissfull&#8221; to the design section (there&#8217;s maybe 5 more of those to add), and updated my screenshot in the about section.  BTW, I&#8217;ve been actually using my webcam a bit lately.  Any requests to look at random crap should be given in #gloom on EdgeIRC (irc.edgeirc.net).  Come on, post more comments!  Discuss the article, the design, the desktop, the webcam, whatever.
34	2002-06-03 20:43:15	Now with more feed	I just added an interesting new feature to wadny.com&#8212;an <acronym title=\\"Really Simple Syndication\\">RSS</acronym> <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/news/wadny-rss.xml\\">feed</a> for the news page.  I doubt it&#8217;ll get much use, since you&#8217;d have to be really interested in my news page and know what an RSS feed is to make any use of it, but I think it&#8217;s a good idea to have the system in place should I ever start updating this page more often or expand my user base.  Anyways, it&#8217;s there if you want it.\n<p>Also, I added a print media stylesheet to my ever-growing collection of metadata tags, so if you print out my site in a standards-compliant browser, you&#8217;ll get a nicer-looking version with less clutter and visible link URLs and all kinds of cool stuff.</p>
35	2002-06-04 18:18:24	Menu improvements	Ok, a couple more changes to the site.  The menu now sends you to www.wadny.com/sectionname/ instead of www.wadny.com/index.php?sec=dumbnumber, which should be much easier to understand and cache better in browsers.  Also, I did a bunch of reworking on the browse script so it actually works this way instead of breaking and being ugly and stuff.  I&#8217;m also working on getting the subdomains set up again, so you&#8217;ll actually have all 4 access methods (see <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/news/during/2001/7/22/\\">July 22nd 2001</a>) working again.
36	2002-06-12 22:02:40	The end of high school	Ok, I finally got around to adding &#8220;pages&#8221; to the news script.  Now the front page only shows the 10 newest news posts, and you can page back and forth using the convenient links along the bottom.  It&#8217;s sort of a hack, but it&#8217;s a lot easier than any kind of real archiving system.  That&#8217;s the last technical obstacle to me actually blogging on this page, instead of just using it as &#8220;the latest updates to wadny.com&#8221;.  All that&#8217;s left is for me to care enough to do anything, heh.\n<p>Well, hey, let&#8217;s throw down some crap to get started&#8230; last &#8220;day&#8221; of school was, today, woohoo!  Unfortunately, I got this really crappy sore throat/cold thing yesterday, and I didn&#8217;t get to go.  I didn&#8217;t really miss anything, just a crappy assembly and getting my yearbook, but I really miss not being able to just talk with people and collect signatures and crap.  I barely did anything social this year&#8230; sometimes it sucks being a computer geek.  Oh well, at least I have college to look forward to; the people there are probably much less stereotypical and dumb than the people at my high school.  Some morons were actually using RAP LYRICS for their senior quotes, ugh.  And they were INTELLIGENT people too, not just your average wigger moron.  It sucks not having gone to parties and stuff like that, but when you realize how incredibly dumb most of these people are it kinda helps make up for it.  Oh well, I&#8217;m hosting a LAN party on Saturday, so that should pick my spirits up. :-D  Time to go get myself on weblogs.com, I&#8217;ll try to start making regular posts from now on.</p>
37	2002-06-13 16:58:26	The pain of encryption	Well, I just had a rather annoying adventure with attempting to use PGP encryption stuff on my e-mail.  I found a plugin/module thing for <a href=\\"http://www.mozilla.org\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mozilla</a> that would supposedly use <a href=\\"http://www.gnupg.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">GnuPG</a> to encrypt or sign my emails and also decrypt or verify incoming emails.  Key word: &#8220;supposedly&#8221;.  As it turns out, there&#8217;s virtually no way to find public PGP keys on the web, so I never managed to verify anything, and the whole thing seemed pretty shoddy, so I removed it.  I might try again sometime, but not anytime soon.  That&#8217;s the problem with open-source stuff&#8230; it usually sounds great and has a lot of neat ideas, but all too often it turns out to be in perpetual beta and doesn&#8217;t do a damned thing.  Also, it appears the Jabber server I use is down; Jabber is (surprise!) an open-source instant messaging system that fakes interoperability with AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo instant messaging systems that kicks ass when it works but breaks far more often than the proprietary systems.  It&#8217;s really annoying how the more open-source a program is, the less reliably it works.\n<p>Oh well, I have one of my two exams tomorrow&#8230; this first one is English 12, oh boy.  The next one&#8212;Regents Physics&#8212;is on Tuesday (the 18th).  After these two exams, I&#8217;m finally done with high school!  W00T!</p>
38	2002-06-14 12:38:23	Exam afterthoughts	I just had the first of my two exams today, this one was Regents English 12.  Not surprisingly, it was damned easy; I could have just BSed the whole thing and probably passed, but I tried a little and wrote a couple decent essays.  Bummed a ride home from a friend&#8230; damn, I need a license and a car.\n<p>Just so you know, I made some more random site changes: I moved all the CSS pages to a subfolder to clean up a bit, added an aural CSS page for my nonexistant blind audience (or anyone who feels like having my website read to them, god only knows why), and updated my <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/misc/playlist.html\\">playlist</a>.  Oh, that&#8217;s right, I forgot to mention: my winamp playlist is posted on wadny.com, in case anyone cares about what I listen to or wants to leech songs off me.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to get psyched up for the lan party I&#8217;m hosting tomorrow, but it sounds like the weather is gonna be pretty sucky and all kinds of people have to leave in the middle or show up late.  Bah.  If anyone lives in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area (well, a little south of it, but close enough) and wants to come to a lan party and isn&#8217;t insane, <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">drop me a line</a>.  If the party gets too boring, we&#8217;ll just take a field trip to a local concert nearby.  Ok, I can&#8217;t think of anything else to write about for now, so maybe I&#8217;ll throw on some more later or just leave it.</p>
40	2002-06-14 23:42:18	Metadazzle overfizzle	<p>HA!  My weblog has more metadata stuff than your weblog!</p>\n<break/>\n<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve got 5 meta tags, 6 link tags, a script tag, and the omnipresent title tag cluttering up my &lt;head&gt;.  A couple of the metas might be useless (I found them in the <a href=\\"http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - New York Public Library Style Guide\\">NYPL Style Guide</a>) but I&#8217;ll leave them unless someone tells me otherwise.  Complying to undefined standards, ooooo fun!</p>\n<p>lanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanparty!  I have NO idea what tomorrow is gonna be like&#8230; that&#8217;s how it typically works with us (the local lan party kids)&#8212;next to zero preparation, just show up and hope people bring hubs.</p>\n<p>Ugh, my ongoing cold thing has now mutated once again.  It started out as a stuffy nose, then added a sore throat, then seemed to clear up, and now it&#8217;s changed into a cough and runny nose.  Isn&#8217;t biology fun?  *cough*</p>\n<p>Attention <a href=\\"http://www.kottke.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - A very well-known blogger who knows lots of other well-known bloggers\\">Jason Kottke</a>:</p>\n<div style=\\"border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px; padding: 3px\\">Sure, you can debate the merits of Mozilla, but it is undeniably better than Netscape 4, primarily because it doesn&#8217;t royally suck at rendering modern, standards-compliant websites (such as mine, megnut, pseudofamous, and countless others).  Back in the good &#8216;ol days of &#8220;Every browser make up a new version of HTML and JavaScript to support, and ignore what anyone else uses&#8221;, Netscape 4 worked  decently well.  However, now we&#8217;re moving into the age of &#8220;Every browser use the official W3C-approved versions of XHTML/HTML/JavaScript, and render them the same&#8221;, and Netscape 4 doesn&#8217;t do that.  Mozilla does.  Netscape 4 is an ancient relic now, a fossil of times long gone.\n<p>As for Mozilla&#8217;s seemingly disappointing interface and features, sure, it&#8217;s not as good as it could be, but these people are just doing work in their spare time.  Apple employees are, well, employees.  If you have ideas, submit them to the Mozilla community and see what they think.  Just don&#8217;t expect too much, because these people aren&#8217;t working on Mozilla for a living.  Personally, I&#8217;m fine with Mozilla&#8217;s interface and think the browser works fine&#8212;it&#8217;s certainly better than any of the other options out there, for reasons I&#8217;m too tired to go into right now.</p>\n<p><acronym title=\\"By the way\\">BTW</acronym>, I&#8217;m sorry if this seems harsh or angry or anything.  My thoughts aren&#8217;t very coherent after being up for almost 18 hours and all this text is just kinda running together.  Bleh.</p>\n</div>\n<p>One last thing; it&#8217;s pretty customary for blogs to link to interesting articles or other blogs.  Since I get all my articles off <a href=\\"http://slashdot.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - News for nerds, stuff that matters\\">Slashdot</a> and <a href=\\"http://www.kuro5hin.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Technology and culture, from the trenches\\">Kuro5hin</a> anyways, you can just page through those sites.  Here&#8217;s a random blog <a href=\\"http://www.pseudofamous.com/archives/00000444.htm\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Oooh, there\\'s... comments...\\">link</a>.  Good night, everyone.</p>
41	2002-06-17 15:10:39	Games and racing	Well, that was a fun weekend.  The <acronym title=\\"Local Area Network\\">LAN</acronym> party on Saturday wasn&#8217;t quite what I hoped it was going to be, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad.  It took forever for anyone to show up, so I spent an hour or so watching Kevin Warner play <acronym title=\\"Grand Theft Auto 3\\">GTA3</acronym> and <acronym title=\\"Soldier of Fortune 2\\">SoF2</acronym>.  After people finally showed up, we did a bit of gaming but the network was all fucked up so we didn&#8217;t do as much as usual.  There was a bit of Counter-Strike, Tribes 2, and <acronym title=\\"Grand Theft Auto 2\\">GTA2</acronym>, but most of the time was spent just goofing off.  It wasn&#8217;t too bad, though.  I managed to score GTA3 off someone else, although my comp can&#8217;t run it for shit.  Everything else I have runs fine, but GTA3 was stuttering and running really slow.  Oh well.  After the LAN, four of us went out for a 1am <acronym title=\\"International House of Pancakes\\">IHOP</acronym> run.  Mmm, french toast&#8230; good stuff.  Got to sleep around 2 or 2:30 am.\n<p>I woke up around 1pm on Sunday and staggered around for a bit before settling down to watch the Portland CART race.  Too bad Max Papis had to sit it out, Sigma really needs some funding, but I was glad to hear CART is sticking with Ford and the turbo engines.  Switching to the IRL engine formula would just waste money and lose fans.  I don&#8217;t want to give away the ending for anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen it, so I&#8217;ll just say this: wheel nuts are supposed to STAY ON.</p>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s about it for my weekend; I did quite a bit of stuff but it was almost all on Saturday.  I missed all of the Le Mans coverage, but my dad taped it all so I need to watch that soon.  The Joest Audis probably won again, but I still want to see what happened.</p>\n<p>Tune in tomorrow for the aftermath of my Regents Physics exam!</p>
42	2002-06-20 17:06:57	Updates on lots of things	Gah, that sucked.  For some reason, my website decided to randomly start spewing several pages of warnings and PHP crap on the screen.  I fixed it, but I have no idea why it broke in the first place.  Looking at what went wrong, it <em>should</em> have broken a while ago, but it didn&#8217;t&#8230; very strange.  Anyways, I kind of slacked on the blogging for a while, so here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:\n<p>First of all, the physics exam went ok, as expected.  It seemed to take a really long time and it was a little harder than the practice exam we got, but it wasn&#8217;t that hard.  I leeched a ride home from the same friend who helped me out after the english exam.  Bah, I still need a license/car&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly working my way through the taped Le Mans coverage, I won&#8217;t be surprised if Audi pulls a 1-2-3.  Those LMP675 MG&#8217;s are doing surprisingly well though, they&#8217;ve been competing with the Audis as well as anyone else.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how their fuel economy helps them over the long run.</p>\n<p>Ok, <a href=\\"http://www.npr.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - National Public Radio\\">NPR</a> is <a href=\\"http://wired.com/news/business/0,1367,53355,00.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - WIRED: Public Protests NPR Link Policy\\">fucking</a> <a href=\\"http://boingboing.net/2002_06_01_archive.html#85180752\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Boing Boing: NPR\\'s brutally stupid linking policy\\">stupid</a>.  In the <a href=\\"http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,48874,00.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - WIRED: Big Stink Over a Simple Link\\">tradition</a> of moronic companies like <a href=\\"http://www.kpmg.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - KPMG - a dumb company\\">KPMG</a>, they are trying to require permission from people to link to them.  I don&#8217;t know why people do this, all it does is backfire on them and within a couple days numerous blogs and websites have posted countless links to them and laughed at how incredibly stupid they are.</p>\n<p>Also, I made some changes to the comments system.  All HTML tags are now stripped from comments except for the following: &lt;a&gt;, &lt;abbr>, &lt;acronym>, &lt;big>, &lt;blockquote>, &lt;br>, &lt;cite>, &lt;code>, &lt;em>, &lt;li>, &lt;ol>, &lt;p>, &lt;small>, &lt;strong>, &lt;sub>, &lt;sup>, &lt;u>, and &lt;ul>.  Obviously, closing tags are allowed also.</p>\n<p>One last thing: in the searchbar, there&#8217;s now a little XML icon that links to the RDF feed for this page.  Feel free to throw it up on aggregators or whatever, but please tell me if you do.</p>
43	2002-06-21 17:40:41	Added playlist link, &#8220;Last Played&#8221;	<p>Ok, after wrestling with some <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym> crap for a few minutes, I added some more things to the nav bar up above.  First, there&#8217;s a link to my playlist up there so you don&#8217;t have to go looking through news posts to find it.  Right next to it is the currently playing song, or at least the last song I listened to.  This is thanks to the <a href=\\"http://www.oddsock.org/tools/dosomething/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Do Something</a> Winamp plugin, which can do a bunch of interesting things, mainly of interest to techies.  I also moved the help! link into the menubar so it&#8217;s not floating around just below it.</p>\n<p>Ugh, I&#8217;m getting really tired of my hosting provider&#8217;s FTP server&#8230; it randomly decides not to let me upload a file until I&#8217;ve deleted the old one.  Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t do it, sometimes it does, and today it&#8217;s breaking more often than not.  Piece of junk&#8230;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s about it for today.  I need more of a social life if I expect to update more often or put anything interesting in here.  My &#8220;friends&#8221; have decided to pretty much ignore me when it comes to doing social things, and it pisses me off but there&#8217;s nothing I can really do about it.</p>
44	2002-06-21 21:15:59	Fixed browse script warnings	<p>Ok, just a quick update.  There were some more problems with big piles of warnings and crap on a different page, so I went ahead and fixed the real cause of the problem instead of hacking on a fix like I did last time.  Theoretically, everything works now.</p>\n<p>For anyone who cares, the problem was part of my browse script&#8212;there are some functions that other pages use to get a list of files in a directory, and those functions were depending on a variable that the browse page set but wasn&#8217;t getting set by the other pages.  I fixed it so one of the functions sets a different variable and they all use that now.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2002-06-21T22:43:00-05:00\\">Update @11:43pm:\n<br />Yay, <a href=\\"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/06/21\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Dave Winer</a> is feeling better again.  For those that don&#8217;t know, Dave was hospitalized about a week ago, but he&#8217;s back now.  Also, I&#8217;ve got a <a href=\\"http://boingboing.net/2002_06_01_archive.html#85185359\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Boing Boing: NPR\\'s ombudsman is either a liar or a fool\\">couple</a> of <a href=\\"http://boingboing.net/2002_06_01_archive.html#85189946\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Boing Boing: NPR renews linking lies and strongarm tactics\\">updates</a> on the NPR fiasco, courtesy of Boing Boing.

45	2002-06-25 22:21:36	Television is destorying America&#8217;s youth	<p>Ok, I just got a painful reminder of why I rarely watch TV&#8230; for some strange reason I was watching Smallville on WB (there was absolutely NOTHING interesting on), and I heard a &#8220;scientific&#8221; explanation for something that was so horribly wrong that I actually got a headache.  There were some guys that were able to walk through walls after they got tattoos made of this glowing green stuff from a meteor, and of course they used that ability to rob a bunch of people.  Anyways, here&#8217;s the explanation of how it works: the meteor stuff speeds up their metabolism so now their molecules move really fast and they can walk through walls.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>Let that sink in for a moment.</p>\n<p>The meteor stuff speeds up their metabolism so now their molecules move really fast and they can walk through walls.</p>\n<p>WHAT KIND OF UTTER MORON CAME UP WITH THAT?!  That is undeniably the DUMBEST, most PAINFULLY STUPID thing I have EVER heard.  How can a tattoo made of meteor gunk speed up their metabolism?  It would probably just infect them and they&#8217;d have to go to the hospital.  Why would speeding up their metabolism make their <em>molecules</em> move faster?  Speeding up your metabolism just makes you digest faster, so they&#8217;d eat more food.  Why would making their molecules move really fast let them walk through walls?  If their molecules moved really fast, they would just get hot (temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of a substance&#8217;s molecules or atoms&#8212;if the molecules move faster, they bump into each other more, hence more friction and increased temperature).  And, of course, there&#8217;s the fact that if they can move through walls, they would also fall through their clothes and the floor into the center of the earth, getting charred by the heat of the earth&#8217;s magma in the process.  If they were able to stay above ground, they would suffocate because the air would just move through them like the walls do.  Either way, they wind up dead.</p>\n<p>Even more annoying than this blasphemy of science and logic and common sense is the fact that most of the idiots watching this show will probably hear that line and accept it, maybe even BELIEVE it.  The people of this country are so amazingly dumb that it scares me sometimes.  People who can&#8217;t handle our already pitiful educational standards just aren&#8217;t trying.  This country needs to seriously elevate the quality of its education or we&#8217;ll wind up with an entire nation of complete morons who will listen to something like that and not understand that it&#8217;s complete bullshit.</p>\n<p>&lt;/rant&gt;\n<br/>Bah, I just get fed up with stuff like this sometimes&#8230;  I&#8217;ll cool off in a bit.  Comments?</p>
46	2002-07-03 23:10:05	Graduation and other boring things	<p>Gah, it&#8217;s been a while.  There&#8217;s been a ton of stuff happening, but I&#8217;ve been pretty much avoiding the net lately&#8230; not exactly sure why, I just get in that sort of mood sometimes.  When I&#8217;ve been on the computer, I&#8217;ve been playing <a href=\\"http://www.planetdeusex.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - PlanetDeusEx - a decent site for information and stuff\\">Deus Ex</a>.  If you haven&#8217;t tried this game, you really should&#8212;it&#8217;s an <acronym title=\\"First Person Shooter\\">FPS</acronym> with <acronym title=\\"Role Playing Game\\">RPG</acronym> elements (or an action-oriented RPG) that suits multiple styles of play&#8212;you can run in guns blazing or be a sneaky bastard with equal success, and there&#8217;s a TON of gameplay in here.  You can do a few hours a day and be playing for practically weeks.  It won Game of the Year honors from <a href=\\"http://www.pcgamer.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - A great magazing on PC gaming\\">PC Gamer</a> a while back and holds up pretty well today.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>Ok, on to the latest adventures in my life (oh, boy!).  First of all, we&#8217;ve done some &#8220;remodeling&#8221; of our house recently.  First, we had someone come in to finish the kitchen that we started some work on when we moved into the house about 14 years ago, although we haven&#8217;t gotten everything moved back into place yet&#8212;the microwave is still sitting in the middle of a walkway in the dining room, which is awfully convenient.  :-\\\\  Hopefully it&#8217;ll get put back soon.  Also, we had a different set of guys put up a deck in our back yard and put in a small patio area with some stone paver blocks next to it by the grill.  They took longer than they should have and made a mess and the deck isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s better than what was there before and gives us a place to put the deck table and chairs we bought a while ago.</p>\n<p>Next major story&#8212;I finally had my graduation ceremony for high school!  YAY!!  Truth be told, the ceremony was boring as hell, and as is typical for our school, the administrators did a bunch of stupid things&#8212;the principal sent us to the wrong side of the building and we had to walk back to the other side and everything got delayed, but the actual ceremony was OK.  My diploma says I have sequences in Science and Foreig<em>h</em> Language, but I&#8217;m not surprised my school fucked that up too.  Oh well.</p>\n<p>One thing that peeved me about HS graduation was how everyone was oohing and aahing about the valedictorian having a 100 in A.P. Calculus.  I took actual COLLEGE calculus (1 &amp; 2) as part of an accelerated math program run through <a href=\\"http://www.buffalo.edu/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - State University of New York at Buffalo\\"><acronym title=\\"State University of New York\\">SUNY</acronym> at Buffalo</a> called the <a href=\\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/org/giftedmath/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Gifted Math Program</a> and wound up ranked #1 out of the top math students from across Western New York, but apparently that doesn&#8217;t matter to these people.  I don&#8217;t really mind that much though, I guess, since I&#8217;d rather just get as far away from this dumbass school as possible.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I went to see Minority Report with my dad.  It was definitely a good movie, although I&#8217;m not sure I would call it a classic.  Some parts were pretty squeamish and you could sort of predict what was going to happen near the end, but it was definitely worth the price of admission.  Good stuff.</p>\n<p>Today was spent almost entirely visiting two nearby Frank Lloyd Wright houses.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Frank Lloyd Wright is a famous American architect who designed a number of famous houses and structures near the turn of the century.  We started out by visiting <a href=\\"http://graycliff.bfn.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Graycliff</a>, a summer home created for Darwin D. Martin on Lake Ontario.  After lunch, we saw the <a href=\\"http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Darwin D. Martin House</a>, another home that was (obviously) designed for Darwin D. Martin.  Both of these houses are excellent examples of Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s amazing architecture and are worth seeing if you&#8217;re ever in the area.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s everything I need to catch up on.  Other than getting a new UPS for my computer, I can&#8217;t remember any major developments since my last entry.  Tomorrow should produce something worth writing about, and hopefully I&#8217;ll be getting a laptop and/or digital camera fairly soon.  If I remember anything else interesting about the last few days, I&#8217;ll throw on another post.  For now, I&#8217;ll just hope that this entry fits in a mediumtext entry in MySQL.  :-D</p>
47	2002-07-05 22:29:18	4<sup>th</sup> of July, new designs	Ok, a few things to talk about, I&#8217;ll start with yesterday.  As you may have noticed, yesterday was the Fourth of July, so we went out and did stuff.  The band my dad is in (<a href=\\"http://www.jumpthesharkband.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in new window\\">Jump the Shark</a>, not Wadny) did a little concert at a park for a while and we stayed to watch the fireworks.  I swear, there were more mistakes and screwups with that fireworks show that at all of the other ones I&#8217;ve seen combined.  There were quite a few times when fireworks would go off way too early (practically on the ground) or fall really low and go off or never go off at all.  When things worked, the show was decent, but all those mistakes were very strange.  Despite spending several hours houtside, I got virtually zero tan.  Oh well, I doubt anyone else really cares how pale I am.\n<p>Today I managed to postpone my Deus Ex obsession long enough to get some work done on the website.  I added two new designs to the Design section (EdgeIRC versions 2 and 3) and fixed EdgeIRC version 1 since the link pointed to the actual site, which got redesigned a while ago.  I&#8217;ve also been cleaning up some of the PHP and HTML around the site, adding &lt;acronym&gt; tags and adding link titles to indicate that external links open in a new window and stuff like that.  I also put together a nice little class-based submenu system that should let me write the Gaming section more easily.  Yes, I might actually get the Gaming and mIRC sections working sometime.  Amazing, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;</p>
48	2002-07-06 23:24:30	New menu system	Not a whole lot going on.  Been watching some racing with my dad&#8230; just finished the <acronym title=\\"Championship Auto Racing Teams\\">CART</acronym> Chicago race from last week and some other stuff, but I haven&#8217;t been spending days out of the house like I was earlier in the week.  However, I did get some more work done on the website today.  You&#8217;ll notice that navigating through the about, band, gaming, and mirc sections works differently now&#8212;you get a subdirectory with a real name instead of the unintelligible &#8220;something?subsec=#&#8221; crap I had before.  I didn&#8217;t actually get any real content into the gaming section, but I&#8217;ve got most of the navigation in place, which is the part most likely to give me problems.  Content <em>should</em> be arriving sometime soon&#8230;
49	2002-07-08 21:40:48	Content additions	Added some more site stuff today.  There&#8217;s a new humor article if you want some light reading, and I added <acronym title=\\"First Person Shooter Information Database\\">FPSID</acronym> (the major predecessor to this site) to the design section.  I&#8217;ve also been cleaning up things here and there, moving stuff around, pruning code&#8230; general maintenance stuff.  Just a reminder, you&#8217;re welcome to try and break my code, just let me know if you find anything, either with an <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">email</a> or a comment.
50	2002-07-15 00:27:24	Status quo	Ok, I&#8217;m not sure if I made any real changes to the site since the last update, but certainly nothing major.  One thing I did change was my playlist&#8212;the length of each track is now displayed next to the track, so you can bask in awe at tracks like <strong>Paul van Dyk &#8211; Live at Knebworth, UK 8-11-01</strong>, which is 110 minutes and 29 seconds long (that&#8217;s 1:50:29, if you don&#8217;t want to do math).\n<p>Other news&#8230; there was another lan party on Friday, although I didn&#8217;t host this one.  We got some new people to show up, which is always a good thing, and there was a decent amount of games-playing, thanks to people showing up reasonably on time and mostly staying for the whole thing.  I&#8217;m actually considering getting Warcraft 3, which is a little weird (I&#8217;ve never even really played an <acronym title=\\"Real Time Strategy game\\">RTS</acronym> before).</p>\n<p>Sometime over the coming month or so I plan on getting a bunch of new computer stuff.  I&#8217;m definitely getting a laptop, which should be really useful for college, and I hope to get a new Alienware comp to replace the box I&#8217;m using now, a digital camera (something decent, no more than about 3 megapixels), and some kickass headphones.  I might think of other stuff I want, who knows how much of that I&#8217;ll actually get.</p>\n<p>My life seems to have pretty much stabilized at this point&#8230; no depression, no elation, no major changes or anything.  I am starting to get a bit worried about what my life will be like at college though.  I go through so much routine during the day that I could have some real trouble adjusting.  Then again, I might be able to create a new, easier routine and simplify my life or something.  Who knows&#8230;</p>
51	2002-08-11 22:39:45	Vacation updates, site changes	Gee, almost a month&#8230; I&#8217;m falling back into my regular routine.  Well&#8230; I&#8217;ve done a few things since the last update.  I went to an <acronym title=\\"Sports Car Club of America\\">SCCA</acronym> autocross with my dad one weekend, found out who my roommate at <acronym title=\\"Rochester Institute of Technology\\">RIT</acronym> will be (he lives in Colorado, quite a ways further away than I am), bought a laptop (our first, a $900 Compaq that isn&#8217;t real fast but should be plenty for taking notes at college), and took a week-long vacation to Quebec.  Whee!  There&#8217;s probably more I&#8217;m forgetting, heh.\n<p>The only thing in that list worth explaining more is the Quebec vacation.  First we headed out to Trois-Rivi&egrave;res (Three Rivers) for the <a href=\\"http://www.gptr.qc.ca/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Grand Prix de Trois-Rivieres\\">&#8220;Grand Prix&#8221;</a>, which was actually <acronym title=\\"American Le Mans Series\\">ALMS</acronym>, Trans-Am, Speed World Challenge, Toyota Atlantic, and Canadian Formula Ford races all rolled into one big three-day weekend.  We had a good time and saw some nice racing (and got sunburned) and then headed off to a campground (we took our motorhome for this vacation) just outside of Montreal and spent three days wandering around the city.  We saw the botanical gardens and an IMAX movie at the science center and wandered around a lot and got the obligatory Hard Rock Cafe shirts and had an excellent dinner at a little cafe called Le Grille.</p>\n<p>Another newsworthy item: I just ordered an Alienware computer to replace my aging desktop system.  It&#8217;s a customized Aurora DDR system and should be a massive improvement over this old T-bird 900mhz box.  Of course, since we waited until AFTER the vacation to order it, I get to spend my last week before leaving for college scrambling to install all the stuff I need&#8212;<a href=\\"http://www.mozilla.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\"  title=\\"Opens in a new window - An open-source, standards-compliant, kickass web browser\\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\\"http://www.mirc.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - The most popular IRC client for windows\\">mIRC</a>, <a href=\\"http://psi.sourceforge.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - A nice win32 Jabber client\\">Psi</a>, etc.&#8230;</p>\n<p>Lastly, the site has once again changed a bit: you&#8217;ve probably noticed this box on the right side of the page labeled &#8220;The Sidebar&#8221;.  This is kind of an experiment for a better way to arrage some of the content on the site and clean up the menu block.  I may wind up putting all of the menu stuff into this side box at some point in the future, but for now I&#8217;m just playing around a bit.</p>
52	2002-08-12 18:59:47	CSS updates, Alienware call	A bunch of little CSS changes and stuff&#8230; headings and submenus now have little borders around them, some redundant CSS rules were removed, and the search boxes at the bottom are now default colors instead of the same yellow as the rest of the site.  Also, you may not be able to tell, but I changed the yellow color (*gasp*!).  It&#8217;s now a lighter yellow that isn&#8217;t quite so gold, and I like it better.  I also added validator links to the sidebar so you can confirm that this site is valid <acronym title=\\"eXtensible (or eXtended) HyperText Markup Language\\">XHTML</acronym> and <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym>, although since I use a <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/xhtml11-target.dtd\\" title=\\"The custom wadny.com DTD - feel free to use it for yourself, if you so desire\\">custom <acronym title=\\"Document Type Definition\\">DTD</acronym></a>, the W3C validator doesn&#8217;t realize my page is XHTML 1.1.  Oh well.\n<p>Gotta go eat dinner now, updates on <abbr title=\\"Real Life\\">RL</abbr> coming soon.</p>\n<ins datetime=\\"2002-08-12T20:17:40-05:00\\"><p>Update @ 8:17pm:\n<br />Well, I got the confirmation call from Alienware today to confirm shipping address and credit card info and that sort of stuff, so the computer should be officially ordered now.  Of course, I&#8217;ll be at <acronym title=\\"Rochester Institute of Technology\\">RIT</acronym> before we get it, so setting it up will be a real pain.</p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s also some good news: there&#8217;s another <acronym title=\\"Local Area Network\\">LAN</acronym> party planned for this Friday, so I&#8217;ll get a chance to meet with &#8220;the gang&#8221; before we all head off for college.  With any luck we might actually have some fun and play some games, too.  It&#8217;s too bad I won&#8217;t be able to bring the Alienware system, though&#8230; that would probably be quite a spectacle.  :-D</p></ins>
53	2002-08-19 00:34:35	Redesign, LAN party wrapup	Huh.  Stuff is, like, different.  I got tired of the halfway-between-designs junk with the sidebar and the top menubar and all that ugliness, so I redesigned the site.  I think this design is definitely cleaner than the old one, although it might be a bit more complex underneath.  Notice the mouseover borders on the menu boxes and the icon, thanks to <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym>.  I&#8217;ve also fixed the comments page and help box, so the site should work fine.  Opinions/bug reports are welcome, either post a comment or send me an <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">email</a>.\n<p>So, the lan party was ok, I guess&#8230; overnighters are always kind of a pain, and people wind up falling asleep partway through&#8212;this time it was two people, one of them was the host.  He decides to make the party overnight and then can&#8217;t stay awake through the whole thing.  Oh well, maybe this will help convince the gang that single-day lans are the best.  The rest of the party was good though.  We didn&#8217;t quite live up to our old variety of games (no Wolfenstein, no CS, no GTA2&#8230;) but at least we played something besides WC3 this time.  I did surprisingly well in UT; I was higher up the frag count list than I thought I would be, although that&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m an evil bastard and I never got very far away from my base.  I did attempt a flag run once or twice, but never got very far.  Oh well.</p>\n<p>College in a week or so&#8230; I still don&#8217;t feel ready at all.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2002-08-19T00:49:00-05:00\\">Update @ 12:49am:\n<br/>I updated my playlist, since I ripped 4 CD&#8217;s recently and it changed quite a bit.</ins></p>
54	2002-08-21 00:00:51	HTML improvements, anniversary	Ok, some more tweaking to the site&#8230; I fixed the dashed border separating the menu from the content so it doesn&#8217;t partially disappear or get displayed twice, changed the headings (gray boxes with bold text) to real &lt;h1> and &lt;h2> tags, and cleaned up some of the <acronym title=\\"HyperText Markup Language\\">HTML</acronym> for text browsers and/or screen readers.  I doubt anyone reading this site uses one of those, but if you are, the site should be easier for you to use now.  Of course, that means the HTML is also cleaner and there&#8217;s less to download, so the page should load faster.  Good stuff all around.\n<p>I noticed that my news posting system will be 2 years old on September 6th&#8230; I&#8217;m amazed it&#8217;s lasted that long.  Hooray for me!</p>
58	2003-05-07 23:47:28	New Year&#8217;s update (in May)	Hmm, it&#8217;s been a long time since my last update.  As you can see, the website has been seriously redesigned, and there&#8217;s been plenty of stuff worth talking about.  As soon as I get the news post script to not suck, I&#8217;ll make a real update.\n<p>Also, I would like to note that my soul has since been traded to Dungeon Siege and from there to Ragnarok Online, where it currently resides.</p>
55	2002-08-26 19:01:22	New e-mail address	Ok, some relatively important news: my email address has changed.  I am now using <a href=\\"mailto:qid[at]wadny.com\\" title=\\"Replace the [at] with an @ if you don\\'t have javascript\\" onclick=\\"location.href=email(); return false\\">qid[at]wadny.com</a> as my primary email address, since qid[at]edgeirc.net is apparently no longer working.  Of course, the edgeirc.net address was the reply-to for my primary email account and I was using it for virtually all contact information, so having to switch over is really annoying.  I&#8217;ve fixed every email link I can find, and also got around to cleaning up some of the older news posts.\n<p>I leave for college tomorrow morning.  I hope I can get everything ready in time&#8230;</p>
56	2002-08-27 21:36:51	Moved in to RIT	Ok, so I&#8217;m here in my dorm room now&#8230; met my roommate and everything, he&#8217;s right here, reading a book I recommended to him (The Mind Pool by Charles Sheffield).  First day went pretty much ok.  Got all my ID&#8217;s and keys and junk, should be ready for this Honors Retreat thing tomorrow&#8230; kind of annoying, to get here and immediately pack to go to this overnight thing, but oh well.  Website updates may become sporadic or might not change&#8212;I can&#8217;t say, since classes don&#8217;t even start until Thursday next week.  There should be a couple other guys from my school arriving in a couple days, I&#8217;ll probably try to help them get settled in.  Bleh, I don&#8217;t want to make this a &#8220;details of my boring life&#8221; post, but I&#8217;m not feeling very philosophical right now.\n<p>I wonder how many other people I can get hooked on good trance music; Northern Exposure is such an awesome CD.</p>\n<p>OC3 dorm connection = the bomb&#8230; 1MBps upload and download, yummy.  Maybe I can shoutcast/oggcast some nice high-quality streams now.  If I ever start broadcasting regularly, I&#8217;ll throw a link in the menu.</p>\n<p>Bah, I don&#8217;t feel like saying anything else.  So there. :-p</p>
57	2002-10-24 17:17:43	Updated RSS feed	Well, I&#8217;ve been doing craploads of stuff here at RIT, and I haven&#8217;t had much motivation or time to update the site, but I just wanted to note that my <acronym title=\\"Really Simple Syndication\\">RSS</acronym> feed has been updated to RSS version 2.0 and is now validated, which should make all none of you using news aggregators to read my site quite happy.\n<p>General status, for anyone who&#8217;s wondering: classes are either boring or interesting, the people here are fun, and Warcraft III has devoured my soul.</p>
59	2003-05-12 21:54:37	Major overhaul	Ok, now that I&#8217;ve got the news posting system working (and I don&#8217;t have to manually add entries with the SQL frontend) I&#8217;ll go ahead and post on what&#8217;s changed.\n<break/>\n<p>First, and most obviously, I&#8217;ve seriously redesigned the site.  I&#8217;m still hemming and hawing over various parts of it, but I think this is good enough.  There are parts I need to put back in still&#8212;the multisearch form, aural and print styleshets, and I want to get the &#8220;open external links in a new window&#8221; checkbox working properly with cookies so it saves your choice.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice a few links are missing&#8212;the help page is gone, since I somehow doubt that anyone would have difficulty understanding my website now.  Website design links are now under about &gt; links (makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it?).  The validation links have moved to the footer.</p>\n<p>Also, the backend has gotten some overhaul&#8212;a few sections are structured more logically now, and I&#8217;m converting other sections to the new system, so there might be brief periods where a section is broken while I&#8217;m converting it.  I&#8217;ve also turned register-globals off, which might break some pages.  Please tell me if you find any pages that don&#8217;t work or don&#8217;t validate.</p>\n<p>The mIRC section has been removed in favor of a more general programming section, which you&#8217;ll notice is &#8220;Coming soon!&#8221;.  This is something I really hope to get working, because I have a fair amount of code laying around that I plan on releasing under the GPL.  You can use the browse script to look through what&#8217;s already uploaded, feel free to download any of it but I make no guarantees that anything will work and I reserve all rights unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<p>I think that just about covers it for the website.  I uninstalled Ragnarok Online the other day because the lag was getting so horrible, so my soul is free for the moment.  We&#8217;ll see if something else manages to catch it.</p>

63	2003-05-28 22:00:44	Cookies are such a pain	Ok, the hell with the stupid &#8220;open links in new windows&#8221; checkbox.  External links open in new windows, and that&#8217;s it.  Also, my website is no longer being served as application/xhtml+xml, for reasons which I shall explain shortly.\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2003-10-26T00:00:00-05:00\\">Update on October 26, 2003: Obviously, I haven&#8217;t explained this yet.  I&#8217;ll put up a new post sometime instead of just modifying this one.</ins></p>
64	2003-08-07 00:38:38	Summer update	Dangit, now that shinji got his <a href=\\"http://www.rapidhate.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - shinji\\'s goofy little weblog\\">website</a> hosted on <a href=\\"http://www.r1hosting.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Hosting by R1CH - highly recommended\\">r1hosting</a>, he&#8217;s making my update schedule look positively lethargic.  Perhaps if more happened in my life I would post more, but, eh&#8230;\n<break/>\n<p>Last night was the annual <a href=\\"http://www.scca.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Sports Car Club of America\\">SCCA</a> picnic here in the <a href=\\"http://www.wny-scca.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Western New York region Sports Car Club of America\\">Western NY region</a>.  Good food, got to hang around with a bunch of cool people.  Oh, and I got a ride in a brand-new M3.  :-D  Such a kickass car&#8230; if only I could afford one.</p>\n<p>Something else that&#8217;s sort of cool: I am now the proud owner of possibly the only Nerf <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/pictures/Sharpshooter%20II.jpg\\" title=\\"Picture of my Nerf Sharpshooter II\\">Sharpshooter II</a> with a custom-fabricated <a href=\\"http://www.wadny.com/pictures/Sharpshooter%20II%20pull%20ring.jpg\\" title=\\"Picture of the aluminum pull ring\\">aluminum pull ring</a> (or aluminium for the brits).  I think it looks pretty nice, and at least I can use the gun again.</p>\n<p>The biggest event since my last post, I got one of my wisdom teeth out.  My god, that was an unpleasant experience.  The surgery itself was disgusting enough to still make me feel sick to my stomach when I recall it, but fortunately not horrifically painful.  The recovery was more annoying, having to chew on one side of my mouth for a week and deal with the pain, which was rather annoying at times.  Realistically, though, it was easy to get through, and it&#8217;s been about a month and I&#8217;m back to normal now.</p>\n<p>What else happened since my last update that&#8217;s worth knowing?  Not a whole lot&#8230; spent a couple days helping my dad with roofing work on the house, that was highly not fun.  Got an air conditioner and returned it because it sucked.  Got a new Klipsch <a href=\\"http://www.klipsch.com/product/product.aspx?cid=103\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Promedia 2.1</a> speaker system, a HUGE improvement over the intermittent and wimpy Boston Acoustics system I had before.  Installed linux on my laptop and discovered my wireless card is virtually unsupported, I&#8217;ll try putting Win2K on there next.  I&#8217;ll post more as I remember.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s coming up in the future?  In a couple weeks the parents and I pack up the motorhome and head north for the <a href=\\"http://www.americanlemans.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">American Le Mans Series</a> Grand Prix at <a href=\\"http://www.mosport.com/2003/alms.htm\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mosport</a>, which will hopefully have better weather than the yucky rain we got last year.  I head back to <a href=\\"http://www.rit.edu/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Rochester Institute of Technology\\">RIT</a> on September 5, I&#8217;m actually looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>Ok, I&#8217;ll leave it at that for now.</p>
65	2003-08-10 17:53:18	I hate Compaq	Eep!  Roommate!\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>And we now return you to the continuing saga of My Crappy Compaq Laptop:\n<br />The trackpad appears to be dying again, but this time it&#8217;s being highly intermittent without actually giving me the <acronym title=\\"Basic Input/Output System\\">BIOS</acronym> error I had before.  However, considering I just restored it from the recovery CD anyways, they can&#8217;t claim it&#8217;s a software problem.  Unfortunately, the warranty expires in less than a week, so I&#8217;ll have to shell out at least $80 to keep it covered, which sucks.  If this damned thing would just WORK it would be a decent laptop.  :-|</p>\n<p>I wonder if cheese became a funny word after all of the debate over whether it was a funny word that resulted in the decision that it isn&#8217;t?</p>
66	2003-08-10 22:59:14	Friday Five	A belated <a href=\\"http://fridayfive.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Five questions to answer in your blog, every friday\\">Friday Five</a>:\n<div><ol>\n<li><b>What&#8217;s the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?</b>\n<br />Montral for the 2003 <a href=\\"http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jwolfs2/csgames/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">CS Games</a> at <a href=\\"http://www.mcgill.ca/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">McGill University</a>.

Probably the time we ran the motorhome off into a ditch trying to get a goofy green bug to go out the window (don&#8217;t ask, and no, I wasn&#8217;t driving).</li>\n<li><b>If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?</b>\n<br />Hmm&#8230; probably something predictable like Hawaii, but <a href=\\"http://www.lemans.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Le Mans</a> is pretty high up on my list too.</li>\n<li><b>Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?</b>\n<br />I&#8217;ve ever actaully &#8220;travelled&#8221; by plane or train (I&#8217;ve been in both but never to actually go somewhere) but I think I&#8217;d prefer car anyways.</li>\n<li><b>What&#8217;s the next place on your list to visit?</b>\n<br />Mosport (see the post from August 7th).</li>\n</ol></div>
67	2003-08-13 14:58:41	Wadny versus robots	Well, I finally got around to setting up a robots.txt file for my site, which should help cut down on some of the spiders and stuff.  I also updated my .htaccess file, which I may post eventually, but not now.  Stupid bots crawling my site pisses me off.  If you&#8217;d like more information on protecting your site against dumb and evil bots, Mark Pilgrim has a <a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/02/26/how_to_block_spambots_ban_spybots_and_tell_unwanted_robots_to_go_to_hell\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - How to block spambots, ban spybots, and tell unwanted robots to go to hell\\">good article</a> on the subject.\n<p>Oops, I forgot about labeling the external links with &#8220;Opens in a new window&#8221; for the last couple of posts.  Sorry if that caught anyone off guard (although I suspect most of my users can see the little arrow).</p>
68	2003-08-14 22:16:33	Anxiety++	Well.  Isn&#8217;t this just fucking wonderful?\n<p>I leave tomorrow for Mosport (see previous posts) and haven&#8217;t even managed to start packing yet.  We&#8217;ll undoubtedly leave several hours late, get there in the middle of the night, and not have nearly as much fun as we thought we would.</p>\n<p>RIT is still down, thus one of the main <a href=\\"http://www.edgeirc.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\">EdgeIRC</a> servers is offline.</p>\n<p>The video card in my desktop suddenly seems to be dying, thus rendering it unusable until we can call Alienware, which won&#8217;t be until at least Monday.</p>\n<p>My laptop hasn&#8217;t been packed up yet and the warranty expires in a day or two and if we don&#8217;t renew it before it expires we can&#8217;t get it covered anymore and we have to pay out the ass to get it fixed.</p>\n<p>Today has been an absolute living hell.  I need to go kill something.</p>
69	2003-08-18 15:55:26	Anxiety--	Well, thanks to the power outage, the traffic to Mosport was incredibly light, so we actually managed to get there at a reasonable hour.  The weekend wasn&#8217;t that bad, I might add more on it later.  Unfortunately, the RIT server is still down so EdgeIRC is still missing a server.  My laptop warranty has been renewed, and it&#8217;s packed up, ready to send back for repairs.  My desktop is still in an unknown state, I&#8217;m running a backup on it right now and hopefully Alienware will fix it, assuming it&#8217;s actually still broken.\n<p>Sanity has returned.</p>
70	2003-08-23 12:16:34	Computer updates	More news:  my laptop is apparently fixed, and Airborne Express already tried to deliver it once while I was asleep.  Alienware has agreed to send me a replacement video card&#8212;they&#8217;re giving me a Radeon 9600 Pro to replace my GeForce4 Ti4600, which is rather nice of them.  Niagara Mohawk came by and replaced our electric meter with a new electronic one, which is good, but they didn&#8217;t tell us they were doing this and just randomly shut off the power to our house, which is incredibly stupid.  Thanks for another power outage, idiots.  Fortunately all our computers have battery backups, so we didn&#8217;t lose anything.\n<p>In other words, nothing&#8217;s changed, but it&#8217;s closer.</p>
71	2003-09-02 22:02:48	I hate Alienware	Current computer status:  laptop is fine.  Brewmeister/risotto is fine.  My desktop is acting as if it&#8217;s fine, but I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s actually working properly or just waiting to break again.  With my luck, it&#8217;ll probably work until I move back to <acronym title=\\"Rochester Instutute of Technology\\">RIT</acronym>, then suddenly die a horrible death.  Who knows?\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s right, you all missed the adventures with my desktop.  Instead of a Radeon 9600 Pro, I got an NVidia GeForce FX 5600 Ultra and there&#8217;s nothing I can do to get the card I actually wanted.  Also, my desktop has been experiencing some highly intermittent, very nasty problems that seem to be hardware-related but I have no clue what&#8217;s actually wrong.  I&#8217;m just keeping my fingers crossed for now.</p>
72	2003-10-21 21:34:30	Stupid broken status indicator	Just a note, if the site ever seems to be running really slowly, the crappy ICQ status indicator might be broken which causes my site to wait until the connection times out before it does anything.  I&#8217;ll probably fix this sometime, although I&#8217;ll have to figure out how first.
73	2003-10-22 08:47:26	Stupid broken status indicator part II	Ok, I just went ahead and removed the IM status indicator, ICQ is being too broken and I&#8217;m usually online all the time anyway.  If you need my screen name or UIN, leave a comment or send an email.  I might put that info in the about section sometime, if I remember to.
74	2003-10-26 12:53:51	Small news changes	So, I&#8217;m planning on doing some more work on my news section&#8230; I&#8217;m going to switch the <acronym title=\\"Really Simple Syndication\\">RSS</acronym> feed to use full posts instead of excerpts, add titles and categories to news posts, add TrackBack support, and maybe add the code to let me delete news posts.  I&#8217;ll probably also be cleaning up some random stuff on the site, but not anything major.  I <em>might</em> do a redesign sometime, because this one is starting to look a little goofy to me, but probably not anytime soon.\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2003-10-26T14:44:00-05:00\\">Update at 2:45pm:\n<br />I just went through all the old news posts and did some revisions, mainly correcting punctuation to use the proper characters (&#8212; for an em-dash and that sort of thing).  Yes, it was an incredibly anal thing to do, but I think it makes the site look a little nicer.  I also cleaned up a couple of acronyms and other boring stuff.  I&#8217;ve got a big list of things to work on, so the site should be improving over the next week or two.</ins></p>
75	2003-10-27 00:27:47	Changed the comments page	Well, I&#8217;ve gone and made some more changes to the news system.  The little popup comments box is gone; the comments links now open a page with just the one news post, the existing comments, and the form to post more.  This is pretty much the standard way most weblogs work and should be nicer to use than the old system.  I&#8217;ve still got to write the code to delete a post, add categories and titles to posts, add TrackBack info to the news pages and the <acronym title=\\"Really Simple Syndication\\">RSS</acronym> feed, switch the RSS feed to use full posts instead of excerpts, write (or find) a simple PHP-based TrackBack server implementation, look over and fix the aural and print stylesheets, and add some other content that&#8217;s been laying around.  Plus I&#8217;ve got to make my schedule for next quarter, finish two lab reports, and do a bunch of homework and reading.\n<p>SERENITY NOW!</p>
77	2003-10-29 22:46:25	Added TrackBack support	Ok, more changes to the news system:  I <em>think</em> I have trackback implemented on my site now.  I don&#8217;t really know whether it&#8217;ll work or not, and I haven&#8217;t set up a system to actually view any trackbacks I get, but there&#8217;s a script that might work.  If you try to trackback my site, post a comment to let me know what happens, and I can check the SQL database to see if it actually made any changes.  I don&#8217;t yet have news post titles implemented, but I&#8217;ll work on that later.  Post titles will actually appear in several places&#8212;the trackback autodiscovery embedded RDF thingy, the RSS feed, and obviously the news page&#8212;plus I need to add them in to the editing system.  I also changed the RSS feed to use full posts instead of excerpts, I hope that won&#8217;t break anything.
78	2003-11-06 23:11:08	More TrackBack features	Ok, a few more changes to news stuff.  The single-post page now has embedded TrackBack autodiscovery stuff (thanks shinji!) and the actual trackback page has been reimplemented slightly differently.  You should now be able to add ?__mode=view to the trackback ping URL and view a list of all trackbacks I&#8217;ve gotten for that post.  However, this won&#8217;t be necessary for very long because I&#8217;m going to put a list of all TrackBacks on the single-post page, probably before the comments.  I might also add a little (# TrackBacks) thing to the main news page so you can easily tell if a post has trackbacks.  We&#8217;ll see.
79	2003-12-27 01:47:35	Lazy, lazy, lazy&#8230;	Lazy, lazy, lazy&#8230;  I haven&#8217;t updated in quite a while, I haven&#8217;t managed to do much with the news system, and the possible redesign <ins datetime=\\"2004-01-12T19:25:00-05:00\\">(this refers to the design you&#8217;re currently looking at, so obviously I finished it)</ins> hasn&#8217;t gotten off the ground yet.  Maybe this weekend I&#8217;ll be able to make some progress, if I get lucky.  In case anyone&#8217;s interested (and so I&#8217;ll remember), this is the current list of things I&#8217;ll be changing: a redesign (most likely); a &#8220;quicklinks&#8221; system (it seems to be a popular thing these days); an improved news system to let you see all posts made during a specific year, month, or day; a calendar showing posts in the current month; titles and maybe categories for news posts; and proper stylesheets for screen readers and printing.  I&#8217;m also wondering what sort of neat metadata-foolery I should try doing&#8212;for example, <a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s weblog</a> has a link with each comment to view other comments posted by that person.  Maybe I&#8217;ll put together a mockup of the redesigned news page soon and see if that helps sort things out.\n<p>There&#8217;s probably a ton of stuff I should have posted on in the last month or two&#8212;school and the holidays and whatnot&#8212;but I&#8217;ll probably never get around to it now.  It&#8217;s late, and I need sleep&#8230; more tomorrow.</p>
80	2004-01-05 00:52:08	Redesign number four million and two	Well, at least it feels like that.  Yes, I&#8217;ve gone and done it again, redesigning the entire site.  This time I did a little more planning though.  The fixed-width design is based on articles like <a href=\\"http://www.notestips.com/80256B3A007F2692/1/TAIO-5TT34F\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - notestips.com article on fixed-width design\\">this one</a> that promote the benefits of having a fixed line width, such as increased ease of reading.  It seems to work just fine, so I think I&#8217;ll keep it.  Also, The Yellow&#8482; is back after an extended hiatus.  Thanks to the <a href=\\"http://www.archive.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Internet Archive</a>, I was able to recover the exact color I used before.\n<p>Some important but less-obvious stuff: ALL menus are now in the sidebar, under &#8220;Main menu&#8221;.  This includes submenus for the About, Band, and Programming sections, and also the menus for the News page.  You may have also noticed that news posts now (finally!) have titles.  All of the old news posts need to have titles set; until then, the news system will automatically substitute the date and time of the post for its title.  NONE of the archives work&#8212;sorry.  I still need to write all of that.  The calendar and quicklinks are also static placeholders at the moment, and recommended links needs to be filled out.  There&#8217;s also a bunch of other new stuff I need to add, including some really neat features I&#8217;ve come up with.  You&#8217;ll just have to wait and see&#8230;</p>
81	2004-01-05 23:38:57	Now with more archiveage	I&#8217;ve got virtually all of the news archives up and running, although they might not look all that great.  The daily archives page is pretty ugly, I&#8217;m going to replace it with some calendar-like thing, or at least something better than a list of every day in the month.  Some old <acronym title=\\"Uniform Resource Locator\\">URL</acronym> forms need to be redirected to the new system so links aren&#8217;t broken, and I also can&#8217;t edit the archives at the moment.  I might just reorganize the entire system to reduce duplicated code, but not tonight.  The sidebar calendar is up and running and comments should work.  Still a lot of work left to do&#8230;
82	2004-01-12 00:04:40	Housecleaning	A couple of small changes: I reorganized the stylesheet very slightly so <acronym title=\\"Internet Explorer\\">IE</acronym> should now use the hover effect on links (the underline goes away to indicate link hover), I removed the useless class=\\"nb\\" stuff for the image links at the bottom of the sidebar (along with the corresponding <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym>) since I can just use selectors to fix them, and I edited the little &#8220;external link&#8221; arrow (which IE users can&#8217;t see&#8212;sorry, I tried) so it should animate a little more smoothly (you can only really notice it on a white background though).  Little tiny changes, trying to make the site just that little bit better.  Of course, there&#8217;s a lot of big, obvious stuff I still have to work on.  That gets saved for when homework is done.
83	2004-01-12 20:33:32	More archive improvements	I changed the daily archive pages so that only days where I actually made posts get listed (which should make it a lot less cluttered), and post titles (if they exist) are given, which should make it easier to find something.  I experimented with a calendar (like the one in the sidebar) but decided that that wouldn&#8217;t work as well.  I&#8217;m going to keep working on the site and make another post later today, which should let me make sure the daily archives handle a day with 3 posts properly.  I also made some changes to the editing system, but obviously I&#8217;m the only one who can tell.
84	2004-01-12 23:38:36	Performance improvements	I made a few small changes and rewrote the calendar rendering to cut page rendering time by about 0.05s.  The old calendar system made an SQL SELECT for every day in the calendar; the new system makes just one at the start to get all the days that have news posts on them.  Between all of the changes I made, page rendering has gone from an average of 0.085 seconds to an average of 0.035 seconds, while using a bit less memory.  This should make my hosting provider happier.  A system to rebuild a set of static HTML pages would reduce load even more, but that&#8217;s a bit too complicated for me to handle myself.  I&#8217;ll probably try to trim the site down even more before I add the quicklinks system, since that will add another SQL select.  Aside from quicklinks, I also plan on adding a Help or About page for the news section, explaining everything it does, along with a couple more small features.  However, the news section is now mostly finished.
85	2004-01-13 17:20:31	Spam is evil.	<p>Doing all this work on my news system has been, basically, a royal pain in the butt.  It takes a lot of time and effort and trying different things and debugging when PHP suddenly blows up in my face and in the end I still don&#8217;t have all the features that come with your average blog software&#8212;but it&#8217;s all worth it, because I don&#8217;t have to deal with <a href=\\"http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000289.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - &#8220;Like crap, falling from the sky&#8221;\\">this</a>.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>There is now an automated system for spamming weblogs based on <a href=\\"http://www.movabletype.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - MovableType, a weblog publishing system\\">MovableType</a>.  Apparently, on <a href=\\"http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/01/12/mt_comment_s/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Mezzoblue: MT Comment Spam\\">weblogs</a> that actually get traffic (read: not mine), comment spam has finally started to register; some people are getting hit pretty bad.  I expect that auto-spamming tools will follow for other weblogging systems.</p>\n<p>However&#8212;and this is where all my work pays off&#8212;I don&#8217;t have to care.  My entire website is custom-written PHP.  It&#8217;s not based on anything else, it&#8217;s not used anywhere else, and none of the technical details are published anywhere.  There is no tool for auto-spamming my site, and somehow I doubt there ever will be one.  I can&#8217;t imagine the spammers being so desperate to reach my readership that they would resort to a custom tool or manual comment entry, but if they are, I have something to say to them: I am ready.</p>\n<p>Spammers have no scruples when it comes to spreading their message.  They will resort to anything&#8212;legal or illegal&#8212;to keep sending spam.  I, on the other hand, have no scruples when it comes to avoiding spam.  I will blacklist <acronym title=\\"Internet Protocol addresses\\">IPs</acronym> and hostnames, or even entire <acronym title=\\"Internet Service Providers\\">ISPs</acronym> and address blocks.  Someone gets blacklisted accidentally and they want off the list?  Too bad, get your ISP to stop hosting spammers.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll add comment text parsing to ban anything that looks like spam.  I&#8217;ll disable comments completely or even move the site to a pure whitelist system, if necessary, to ensure that my site does&#8217;t get used for purposes I don&#8217;t approve of.  You want to get my hosting provider to kick me off?  I&#8217;ll relocate to a nice academic server that happens to be run by a committee of students, and they certainly won&#8217;t listen to you.  Good luck attacking my site name, unless you have prior art from before the 1970&#8217;s.  The domain name is registered by a relative, and he won&#8217;t take kindly to any interference.  We know good lawyers.

86	2004-01-13 22:36:10	The latest news changes	I managed to get a few more things checked off my to do list today.  The news section now has an About page, which lists all of the different stuff my news system does.  It should explain any questions you have about my news system; if it does&#8217;t, send me an e-mail (link is in the sidebar) and I&#8217;ll add some more to the page.  The single-post page is updated to actually display TrackBacks; when I actually get one, you&#8217;ll be able to see it now.  I started adding titles to old news posts; finishing that will take some time.  I finally got the print stylesheet created, so if you print anything out from my site it should look much better now.  There is no aural stylesheet, since I doubt I have any blind readers.  Feel free to correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.  There are a handful of other small changes that nobody  will notice.  Finally, I readded the Amazing Multisearch Bar-That-Is-No-Longer-A-Bar to the sidebar.  You can choose from 30 different search engines (including the default option, which is to search just wadny.com using Google) and search for whatever you want.  The accessibility statement has been updated to reflect the changes that apply to it.
87	2004-01-15 21:38:08	My 2&#0162; on Postel&#8217;s Law	<p>For those who aren&#8217;t deep into the blogging community (or &#8220;blogosphere,&#8221; as it is sometimes referred to), you may not have seen or heard of the Great Postel&#8217;s Law Debate now ensuing.  Here&#8217;s the jist of it: back in 1981 when the <acronym title=\\"Transmission Control Protocol\\">TCP</acronym> standard was finalized, Jon Postel put a comment in <a href=\\"http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/rfc/rfc793.txt\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\"><acronym title=\\"Request For Comments\\">RFC</acronym> 793</a> that says: <q cite=\\"http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/rfc/rfc793.txt\\">TCP implementations will follow a general principle of robustness: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.</q>  Sounds like a simple, good idea, right?</p>\n<break/>\n<h2>The issue at hand</h2>\n<p>We now return to the present day.  A new syndication format, <a href=\\"http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Atom Syndication Format 0.3\\">Atom</a>, is starting to gain momentum and usage in the blogging community.  Feed readers are starting to add support for this format, and the question of whether to accept invalid feeds (in <acronym title=\\"eXtensible Markup Language\\">XML</acronym> parlance, they are &#8220;not well-formed&#8221;) arose.  This is where the issue arises.  Some authors of feed readers don&#8217;t want to handle invalid feeds because it&#8217;s more work for them, and some other people&#8212;some of them feed authors themselves&#8212;have started arguing that not accepting invalid input violates Postel&#8217;s Law, which they consider to be absolutely unacceptable.  A rough outline of the conversation follows:</p>\n<h2>The debate</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/postelsLaw\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Dave Winer: Postel&#8217;s Law has two parts</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/08/postels-law\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mark Pilgrim: There are no exceptions to Postel&#8217;s Law</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://norman.walsh.name/2004/01/12/postel\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Norman Walsh: On Atom and Postel&#8217;s Law</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://dannyayers.com/archives/002169.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Danny Ayers: Bugger Bob</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2770\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Brent Simmons: Postel&#8217;s Law, Atom, and NetNewsWire</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/feeddemon_and_w.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Nick Bradbury: FeedDemon and well-formed Atom feeds</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://bitworking.org/news/There_are_no_exceptions_to_Postel_s_Law_\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Joe Gregorio: There are no exceptions to Postel&#8217;s Law</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/11/PostelPilgrim\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Tim Bray: On Postel, Again</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/01/14/thought_experiment\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mark Pilgrim: Thought Experiment</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001025\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Aaron Swartz: Postel&#8217;s Law Has No Exceptions</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/08/19/Draconianism\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Tim Bray: Dracon and Postel</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The sides</h2>\n<p>Clearly, some people consider this to be an issue of vital importance, and many people are engaged in extended discussion over it.  As far as I can tell, there are two sides: those who say you must always do everything you can to accept invalid input (pro-Postel), and those who say otherwise (anti-Postel).  Each side makes several valid points.</p>\n<h3>Pro-Postel</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Users don&#8217;t want to know how XML works, they just want to use it.</li>\n\t<li>If you just throw up an error message when you get invalid XML, users will move to a different feed reader that parses invalid XML.</li>\n\t<li>There will always be lots of invalid feeds, so if you don&#8217;t handle invalid input you cut off a lot of people.</li>\n\t<li>If other things (like web browsers) violated Postel&#8217;s Law, it could result in very painful situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Anti-Postel</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Parsing invalid XML requires more work from the developers.</li>\n\t<li>If none of the feed parsers handle invalid feeds, authors will be forced into writing valid XML.</li>\n\t<li>If feeds validators DO handle invalid feeds, authors are not encouraged to fix bugs and developers are then forced to incorporate workarounds.</li>\n\t<li>Writing well-formed XML is not particularly difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, these are aggregations, so specific members of either side may disagree with some points on their side, and the discussion is deliberately simplified, but this is merely a brief summary.</p>\n<h2>My opinion</h2>\n<p>So where do I fit in?  I am siding with the anti-Postels in this case, for many reasons.  First, this entire discussion seems to revolve around what a handful of developers want to do with their applications.  <strong>THEIR</strong> applications.  Not ours, not Postel&#8217;s, not Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s, <em>theirs</em>.  If they want to reject invalid XML, they can.  If they want the program to only accept well-formed, perfectly valid Atom feeds, they can.  If they want their program to turn a random shade of blue on the second Tuesday of every month except during leap years, they have every right to go ahead and do that.  If the users don&#8217;t want to use a program that works like that, they can switch to something else.  You&#8217;re welcome to argue this point, but until you can prove that Brent Simmons and Nick Bradbury have to do what you say just because you say it, you&#8217;ll be wrong.</p>\n<p>Feed readers <em>can</em> go ahead and reject invalid feeds if they want to; however, there are two remaining questions: <em>should</em> they reject invalid feeds, and is Postel&#8217;s Law really valid?</p>\n<p>When it comes to whether feed readers <em>should</em> accept or reject invalid feeds, the answer is clear: they should do both.  The ideal peice of software would be configurable so that the <em>user</em> decides what to do with invalid feeds: reject them entirely, present a warning that the feed&#8212;being invalid&#8212;may get bungled in an attempt to read it, display an icon or other passive indication that a feed is invalid, or do nothing at all.  Require them to choose a setting when the program is first run, so there&#8217;s no issue about defaults being incorrect.  Perhaps an option could be given to report invalid feeds to some central database&#8212;call it, say, the &#8220;Syndication Hall of Shame&#8221;&#8212;to encourage authors to fix their feeds (nobody wants to be in a Hall of Shame, after all).  Furthermore, I&#8217;m a little surprised that the concept of giving this choice to the user hasn&#8217;t come up more often, especially considering that the pro-Postel argument is based largely on helping the user.</p>\n<p>Thus, what feed readers <em>should</em> do is give the choice to the users, but not to Postel and his supporters, or to his detractors.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the final question: is Postel&#8217;s Law really valid?  This question is the most difficult to answer, but fortunately it does not need to be answered.  The debate over its validity is probably more useful than the law itself, as debate and deliberation encourages careful study and creation of alternatives.  Indeed, American self-government is based on deliberation; without it, government is reduced to the whims of the majority.  So should we encourage rational debate over the merits of Postel&#8217;s Law.  I believe that Postel&#8217;s Law is worth considering, and important in many circumstances, but it does not apply to everything.  There are many situations where data integrity is critical, and attempting to guess at what broken data means can result in serious problems.  The example of financial transactions has been brought up several times; $2,000.00 and $6,000.00 are very different amounts of money, but they only differ by a single bit.  If bank software received the number 6000 with a parity error, should it happily accept the number and try to fix it?  Hopefully, everyone will answer &#8220;no.&#8221;  Should <acronym title=\\"Computer Aided Design\\">CAD</acronym>/<acronym title=\\"Computer Aided Manufacturing\\">CAM</acronym> software being used to design a bridge accept a malformed file and try to correct for it?  What if this file is an XML format?  Don&#8217;t forget that actual people will be driving across this bridge, and depend on it to not fall apart because a file parser decided that a closing tag went in one place instead of somewhere else and a critical reinforcing beam disappeared.  I&#8217;d much rather have the software bring up a big error box that lets the engineer know very clearly that there is a problem that must be solved&#8212;sounds like an exception to Postel&#8217;s Law to me.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Although I sided with the anti-Postels in this particular debate over feed readers, I believe that Postel&#8217;s Law is still a good general guideline for programmers; the concept of handling invalid input has been around for a long time.  However, we must be careful not to limit ourselves to a handful of laws that we think will always work.  A far better approach is to adapt to the specific circumstances surrounding a project&#8212;i.e., the project domain&#8212;and take all of the requirements into account.  Different domains can require vastly different methods and processes, from ad-hoc all the way to highly structured waterfall model development.  Software&#8217;s behavior should depend on the domain it functions in and the user&#8217;s requirements, not the developer&#8217;s personal convictions.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would remind everyone that this article is merely my opinion.  I have tried to be objective and logical, and welcome any comments or constructive criticism that people have to offer.</p>
88	2004-01-16 23:39:50	Finished adding titles, RSS changes	I just finished adding titles to the rest of the news posts, just so they all look somewhat nicer.  I also added a couple of acronym tags here and there, and marked up some changes with &lt;ins&gt; tags just to be semantic.  I also changed the <acronym title=\\"Really Simple Syndication\\">RSS</acronym> feed to include full <acronym title=\\"eXtensible HyperText Markup Language\\">XHTML</acronym> enclosed in &lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt; tags so it still validates.

Let me know if there are any problems.  I also made a handful of small news system changes; nothing obvious or important, really.
89	2004-01-18 21:56:03	Much more metadata	<p>So, I added a bunch more metadata and linkage to the site today.  The Recommended links section in the sidebar is now filled out with the blogs I read, including <acronym title=\\"XHTML Friends Network\\">XFN</acronym> data.  I added a meta tag for my location and a GeoURL link in the sidebar so you (or I) can see who lives near me.  I added a <acronym title=\\"Friend Of A Friend\\">FOAF</acronym> file so you can learn a little more about me.  Lastly, I revamped the regular About page with a bunch more information and structure.</p>\n<p>You may be interested in this link: <a href=\\"http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1A.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Monitor calibration and gamma</a>.

If people actually read the <a href=\\"http://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/declaration_transcript.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Declaration of Independence</a> anymore, they would know that if government fails to protect our rights, it is not only our right but our duty to <q cite=\\"http://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/declaration_transcript.html\\">alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government</q> that does.  Our government is violating our rights, and yet we do nothing.  Self-government is failing, and if people continue to do nothing then it will eventually collapse.</p>

In other words, requests for www.wadny.com/(anything) are silently redirected to wadny.com/(anything).  Old links are not broken, and users shouldn&#8217;t notice a difference, but it makes me feel better.  I got the idea from <a href=\\"http://rapidhate.org\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Kevin</a>, who is also class B compliant but hasn&#8217;t admitted it.</p>\n<p>In other news, I&#8217;ve been working on getting a few other designs up in the Design section.  They might appear in a few days, and I&#8217;ll make another post with details if they do.  I may also have another big essay-style post (&#224; la My 2&#162; on Postel&#8217;s Law) in the coming days.

92	2004-01-28 22:25:27	Serializing	<p>I just filled out an International Standard Serial Number (or ISSN) application.  For those who don&#8217;t know, <a href=\\"http://lcweb.loc.gov/issn/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">an ISSN is</a> a unique serial number for identifying periodicals, also known as serials.  A serial is a publication issued in successive parts and intended to be continued indefinitely, with issues having unique numerical designations.  Weblogs meet the definition of a serial, and thus qualify for an ISSN.  Joe Clark has a page that <a href=\\"http://fawny.org/issn/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">explains the benefits of ISSNs</a>, and another page that <a href=\\"http://fawny.org/issn/compatibility/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">explains why weblogs are eligible for ISSNs</a>.  I decided to join the likes of <a href=\\"http://www.zeldman.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Jeffery Zeldman</a> (ISSN 1534-0309) and get an ISSN for wadny.com.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll be approved, although I have no idea how long the process takes.</p>\n<p>P.S.: I know I still haven&#8217;t added any new designs or written the article I mentioned; I&#8217;ll get to it eventually.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2004-01-29T15:42:00-05:00\\">Update on January 29th:\n<br />The application form is in the mail; I&#8217;m guessing a few weeks before I get anything back (this is the federal government, after all).</ins></p>
93	2004-01-29 17:07:14	How external links work	<p>Since the redesign, I&#8217;ve been focusing a bit more on my content in an attempt to join the &#8220;inner circles&#8221; of blogging.  I don&#8217;t expect to be the next <a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mark Pilgrim</a> or <a href=\\"http://kottke.org\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Jason Kottke</a>, but I&#8217;d like to move up in the world a bit.  Many of the top bloggers are technical people who often post tips and how-tos, and I figured it&#8217;s high time I added one of my own.  Thus, I decided to write an article on a unique feature of wadny.com: my external links system.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>For those of you with a standards-compliant browser (read: not <acronym title=\\"Internet Explorer\\">IE</acronym>), you&#8217;ve probably noticed that many of the links on this site have a little red arrow next to them that animates when you hover over the link.  These are external links&#8212;links to a page not on wadny.com.  I came up with the idea for them quite a while ago, and the feature has persisted through several redesigns and reimplementations.  They&#8217;re actually pretty simple to implement&#8212;there&#8217;s only three steps: indicating which links are external, styling them with the arrow, and making them open in new windows.</p>\n<p>The first problem is indicating which links are external.  Fortunately, <acronym title=\\"HyperText Markup Language\\">HTML</acronym> already has the solution built in: the <code>rel</code> attribute.  As the HTML specification says, the <code>rel</code> attribute <q cite=\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel\\">&#8230;describes the relationship from the current document to the anchor specified by the <code>href</code> attribute.</q>  The <code>rel</code> attribute contains a space-separated list of values.  Thus, a link with the word &#8220;external&#8221; in its <code>rel</code> attribute indicates that the link points to another website.  If you view the source on this page, you&#8217;ll notice that the only thing identifying external links is <code>rel=\\"external\\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The second problem is styling the external links with the arrow.  Selecting the external links is fairly easy; <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym> provides various <a href=\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#attribute-selectors\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">attribute selectors</a>, including one for matching a space-separated list of words.  That&#8217;s exactly what <code>rel</code> is, so the CSS selector is simply <code>a[rel~=\\"external\\"]</code>.  The image is then inserted as a background on the link using <code>background-image: url(graphics/extern.gif);</code>, positioned to the left horizontally and centered vertically using <code>background-position: left center;</code>, and set to not repeat using <code>background-repeat: no-repeat;</code>.  Then we add some padding to the left of the link to push the text past the image, and voila!  Making the arrow animate on hover isn&#8217;t very difficult either.  We add <code>:hover</code> to the CSS selector to get <code>a[rel~=\\"external\\"]:hover</code>, and put in one <code>background-image:</code> rule to set the image to an animating GIF.</p>\n<p>The last peice of the puzzle is making external links open in new windows.  The traditional way to do this is to add <code>target=\\"_blank\\"</code> to the link tage; however, <acronym title=\\"eXtensible HyperText Markup Language version 1.1\\">XHTML1.1</acronym> doesn&#8217;t recognize the <code>target</code> attribute.  Thus, we have to use another method: JavaScript.  Thanks to the Document Object Model, we can do this with a small peice of code that works in every current browser.  Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\\"http://wadny.com/include/script.js\\"><p><code>1   function setExternalLinks() {\n2      if ( !document.getElementsByTagName ) {\n3         return null;\n       }\n \n4      var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName( \\"a\\" );\n5      for ( var i = 0; i &lt; anchors.length; i++ ) {\n6         var anchor = anchors[i];\n7         if ( anchor.getAttribute( \\"href\\" ) &amp;&amp;\n8              anchor.getAttribute( \\"rel\\" ) == \\"external\\" ) {\n9            anchor.setAttribute( \\"target\\", \\"_blank\\" );\n          }\n       }\n    }\n\t\n10  window.onload = setExternalLinks;</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>So, how does this work?  First, we create a function (line 1) to do the work.  Then we check (line 2) to make sure that the script is being run in a <acronym title=\\"Document Object Model\\">DOM</acronym>-capable browser.  If it&#8217;s not, then just abort (line 3).  Otherwise, we continue on to line 4 and get an array of every link in the page.  We loop through every link (line 5).  For each link (line 6), we check to make sure it&#8217;s actually a link and not an anchor (line 7), and also that it&#8217;s an external link (line 8).  If it is, then we set the <code>target</code> attribute to &#8220;_blank&#8221; (line 9).  Finally, on line 10, we set it up so that this function gets called after the page has finished loading.  Please note that if you have any other scripts that need to be run after the page has finished loading, you&#8217;ll need to replace line 8 with code to make all of the scripts run.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know much about CSS or JavaScript, this may be a little over your head.  However, with a little work, it&#8217;s not too difficult to figure out.

94	2004-02-06 00:24:59	Site changes, part MCMXVII	Yep, it&#8217;s time for another update on various changes I&#8217;ve made to the site, in rough chronological order.  First, the RSS feed has been changed: there are now two RSS feeds, one with full posts and one with only excerpts.  This should provide a choice for those of you that want one, but there&#8217;s another reason: the excerpt feed has an <acronym title=\\"eXtensible Markup Language\\">XML</acronym> stylesheet, so if you view it in a web browser, it looks just like a regular wadny.com page, even though it&#8217;s still just RSS.  It&#8217;s actually pretty cool, and didn&#8217;t require as much work as I thought it would.  The next big change is that the sidebar is now placed below the content in the page source, so people using text browsers or screen readers no longer have to bother with the skip navigation link (in fact, I removed it).  This should also make Google happier, since my content is at the top of the page.  However, the most useful change I made is to the archives page&#8212;I added forwards and backwards links to the archives system, and &lt;link&gt; tags for next, prev, and up.  These links should make navigating the archives section much easier, since you can now page back and forth.  Users of Lynx or Mozilla with the site navigation bar enabled should be able to move around the archives much more easily now.  Enjoy!
95	2004-02-11 01:29:09	It&#8217;s evolution	Obviously, the site has changed again.  The design changes should be obvious; I thought the site could use some more color and style, since it was pretty plain before.  I also made some small code changes, the most noticeable being that I changed &#8220;Archives home&#8221; in the archive pages to a link to go up a level in the archives.  Let me know what you think.
96	2004-02-12 00:59:17	Linkdump	<p>Some random thoughts and links from across the web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shockwave/flash video of a guy <a href=\\"http://brewmeister.cs.rit.edu/~dlo6351/yuri_harmonica.swf\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">playing the harmonica and doing vocal percussion</a> at the same time (warning to dialup users, it&#8217;s 4<acronym title=\\"Megabytes\\">MB</acronym>) (<a href=\\"http://louhi.kempele.fi/~skyostil/archive/dump/flash/yuri_harmonica.swf\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">original location</a>).</li>\n<li>Someone made a <a href=\\"http://www.ebaumsworld.com/stewie-familyguy.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Stewie Griffin soundboard</a>, also in shockwave/flash.</li>\n<li>A well-written <a href=\\"http://www.worldofends.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">essay on some things the Internet actually is</a> (see also <a href=\\"http://www.cluetrain.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">the cluetrain manifesto</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\\"http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail97.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Strong Bad E-Mail #97: Monument\\">Thnikkaman</a> is the <a href=\\"http://www.zombo.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">zombo.com</a> of superheros.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is all.</p>
97	2004-02-12 20:51:43	Comment additions	I made a couple slight additions to the comments system.  First, I changed the e-mail field to a <acronym title=\\"Uniform Resource Locator\\">URL</acronym> field, where you can basically stick whatever kind of URL you want.  You can still put in just a plain e-mail address, and mailto: will get added to the front of it automatically.  Also, I added permalinks to the comments, so you can post a link to any specific comment.  This should come in handy if my site ever has any large conversations going on.  I&#8217;ve also updated the News &gt; About page with this information.
98	2004-03-09 01:20:17	Busy, busy, busy	<p>So, obviously it&#8217;s been a while since my last post.  <acronym title=\\"Rochester Institute of Technology\\">RIT</acronym> runs on a quarter system (as opposed to a semester system), so we just had exams and a break.  I was too busy during exams to post, and nothing really worth mentioning on here happened during break.</p>\n<p>So, that brings us to today&#8212;I just updated the design section with a new design (EdgeIRC version 4) and redid all of the thumbnails so you can see the design better.  Jakob Nielsen calls this &#8220;<a href=\\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9611.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window: Marginalia of Web Design (Jakob Nielsen\\'s Alertbox November 1996)\\">Relevance-Enhanced Image Reduction</a>;&#8221; Jakob Nielsen also uses big words for no apparent reason.  I&#8217;d just call it &#8220;cropping and resizing,&#8221; but maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not a so-called &#8220;usability expert,&#8221; making a bajillion dollars, with a website that looks like it was made by a third-grader.</p>\n<p>As long as we&#8217;re on the subject of Generally Not-Good Things, Lockergnome has just done <a href=\\"http://channels.lockergnome.com/web/backissues/20040303.phtml#20040303_1\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window: Lockergnome GNOMEREPORT: Busy Bees In The Hive\\">the dumbest thing ever</a>: after turning an ugly, old, table-based hack design into a clean, decent-looking standards- and <acronym title=\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\">CSS</acronym>-based design, they (for some unfathomable reason) switched back.  This is a slap in the face to countless people who have worked so hard to bring the web out of the tangled mess of nonstandard markup, and it ensures that I will never visit Lockergnome&#8217;s site and never believe anything they say again.

99	2004-03-10 22:52:02	More on Lockergnome	<p><a href=\\"http://photomatt.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window: Photo Matt - Unlucky In Cards\\">Matt Mullenweg</a> has written a couple of excellent posts on the Lockergnome scandal.  The first, &#8220;<a href=\\"http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/03/09/worse/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">It&#8217;s Worse Than You Can Imagine</a>,&#8221; mentions Simon&#8217;s post (see <a href=\\"http://wadny.com/news/during/2004/3/9/0120/\\" title=\\"wadny.com: Busy, busy, busy\\">my previous post</a>) and explains how to unsubscribe from Lockergnome, which I would do if I had ever subscribed in the first place.  His second post, &#8220;<a href=\\"http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/03/10/code-is-food/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Code is Food</a>,&#8221; explains why anyone should care about Lockergnome regressing into the Bronze Age of webdesign.  It&#8217;s one of the best essays I&#8217;ve ever read on why you should care about web standards, not just on your own site but on every site.</p>\n<p>By the way, I do plan to have some new content in the near future, instead of just linkposts to other people&#8217;s content.  I&#8217;ve got some more design section stuff to do, the consistently-neglected programming section to work on, a couple technical things to work on, and a post idea rattling around somewhere.  We&#8217;ll see how my weekend goes.</p>

101	2004-03-18 00:20:50	Now with indivisible pieces	<p>So I went and changed the syndication system again.  This time it should actually be an improvement, however.  I pulled out the ugly double <acronym title=\\"RDF Site Summary\\">RSS</acronym> feed system and replaced it with a single <a href=\\"http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - The Atom Syndication Format 0.3 Specification\\">Atom 0.3</a> feed system.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>Atom requires keeping track of the time when posts are modified, which is probably a good idea anyways, so now that process is automated and a notice should be displayed when a post is updated.  If you&#8217;re interested, the symbol next to the update notice (&#8710;) is delta, which scientists often use to mean \\"change in\\" (for example, &#8710;x means \\"change in x\\").</p>\n<p>So why did I bother?  Well, once I looked at the two formats it was obvious that Atom was designed for syndicating weblogs, whereas RSS was designed so Dave Winer could see his name all over the place, or something similarly egotistical.  If you haven&#8217;t noticed, <a href=\\"http://archive.scripting.com/2004/03/09#rssIsRaging\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Dave pretends that the real world cares about RSS\\">Dave is kind of</a> an <a href=\\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/2004/03/08#a1243\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Dave pretends that RSS doesn&#8217;t suck as much as it does\\">arrogant jerk</a>.

Atom is already better than RSS, and it&#8217;s still under highly active development.  I&#8217;ll try to keep my feed up-to-date; let me know if there are any problems.</p>
102	2004-03-24 23:27:45	Design updates	<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of work on the design section recently.  First, I added an introduction page to explain the new organization.  As for the new organization itself, the design section is now split between separate, extended portfolio sites for a handful of my more recent designs and the old big summary page for the rest of my designs.  The summary page has been updated a little and there&#8217;s a new design.  The separate portfolio site for wadny.com isn&#8217;t finished yet, but hopefully it will be soon.  There are also a couple of other designs I&#8217;m hoping to put up later.</p>\n<p>I also made a couple other changes to the site design&#8212;there are some new links under Recommended, the buttons have been updated, and I changed the line-height for body text, which makes the site considerably more readable (I wish I had discovered that earlier).</p>

105	2004-04-21 23:15:36	Blogroll system	So, I&#8217;ve gone and added more stuff to my news system.  This time I created an <a href=\\"/news/blogroll/feed/\\">automatic blogroll feed-generator</a>.  I got the idea from <a href=\\"http://bensinclair.com/archives/000201.php\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - BenSinclair.com: Python Power!\\">Ben Sinclair</a>, and built my own system using the core of his script with my own interface wrapped around it.  Every hour, a cron job runs my version of Ben&#8217;s python script, which fetches all of the feeds for the sites in my blogroll, compiles all the entries together, crops the list down to the newest 50, compiles them together into a file, and runs tidy on that file to make it reasonably valid XHTML.  It&#8217;s not perfect yet, but I&#8217;ll keep working on it.
106	2004-04-24 15:53:09	Spring is here	<p>Well, spring has been here for a while now, so I decided it was time to update my header image.  I couldn&#8217;t bear to colorize that sky, so I made the header and footer blue and the sidebar yellow.  I may begin rotating header images more frequently, if I can find some nature around here.  I also stuck some borders in the sidebar to help clearly delineate each section.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2004-04-24T17:32:00-05:00\\">Update at 5:32pm:\n<br />Looks like I was only a <a href=\\"http://mamamusings.net/archives/2004/04/21/my_rite_of_spring.php\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - mamamusings: my rite of spring\\">couple of days late</a>.</ins></p>\n<p><a href=\\"http://dris.dyndns.org:8080/archives/675/index.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Passive Digressive - 23rd post\\">Chris</a> told me to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go into your blog&#8217;s archives.</li>\n<li>Find your 23rd post (or closest to).</li>\n<li>Find the fifth sentence (or closest to).</li>\n<li>Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My <a href=\\"http://wadny.com/news/during/2001/7/19/\\" title=\\"Still recovering\\">23<sup>rd</sup> post</a> is rather simple, so I&#8217;ll paste it in entirety:</p>\n<blockquote cite=\\"http://wadny.com/news/during/2001/7/19/\\"><p>The old news database files are saved, but I need a way to convert them into plaintext or somehow get them into this server, so the news will be missing for a while.

Mr. Winer, seriously: give it a rest.  If RSS is so superior and so widely used, then why are you so scared of Atom?  And why are you so eager to monopolize on one syndication format?  Different formats may suit different applications, and trying to force a square application into a round format isn&#8217;t going to work any better than pegs and holes.  And what if Atom is better?  If people don&#8217;t want to use RSS, trying to force it down their throats won&#8217;t change anything.  Let the people decide what they want.  If they choose Atom, then so be it.

As a result, many people using MovableType are considering moving to another system.  As <a href=\\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - dive into mark - Freedom 0\\">Mark Pilgrim explained</a>, non-Free software is always riskier than Free software, no matter how much you trust the developers.</p>\n<p>So, where do I come in?  The answer is, I don&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s the nice part.  I don&#8217;t have to worry about my weblog system suddenly costing money for upgrades, because I make my own weblogging system.  What would I have to do, pay myself?  MovableType is a nice system&#8212;I&#8217;ve tried it a bit myself&#8212;but it&#8217;s much easier just having my own system that always does exactly what I want it to.</p>

113	2004-06-09 21:09:47	RIT doesn&#8217;t get it	<p>Up until today, I thought I went to a pretty good university.  Good people, an Honors program, a true undergraduate Software Engineering major, decent budget, etc., but that all stopped today.  RIT, despite being a technical university populated with geeks of the highest caliber, does not understand computers or the Internet.  Why?</p>\n<break/>\n<p>A little background information: the Software Engineering program requires all students to take 4 quarters of co-op&#8212;working at an employer full-time in a computing field, basically.  When you are on co-op, as I am this summer, you must register it with the co-op office.  They provide a web-based form to do this.  Sounds simple, right?</p>\n<p>Except the form <strong>requires Internet Explorer <em>and Javascript enabled</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Let me remind you, this is <q>a technical university populated with geeks,</q> meaning many students run Linux exclusively.  Apparently they\\'re not allowed to go on co-op.</p>\n<p>And what of students with disabilities, who cannot use a Javascript-enabled browser?  Or students who don&#8217;t have internet access?  Apparently, they&#8217;re fucked.</p>\n<p>When I discovered the form didn&#8217;t work in Mozilla, I sent them a short e-mail saying the form didn&#8217;t work and included the required information in the e-mail.  You&#8217;d think they would send a polite reply, saying the form would be fixed, and thanks for the e-mail, your co-op is registered now.</p>\n<p>But this is where they crossed the line.  Their response, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The web form is not broken.  You need to use Internet Explorer, not Netscape.  Please report your job using the on line form on Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you continue to have problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of trying to help me&#8212;that&#8217;s what their job is&#8212;they told me to go fuck myself.  I am absolutely <em>astonished</em> at the pure ignorance and stupidity of this reply.  I can&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;m the only person who has had this problem, and the solution would not be difficult, but they refused to do anything to help me.  They didn\\'t even say \\"sorry!\\"</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m speechless.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\\"2004-06-09T22:10:00-05:00\\">Update at 10:10pm:\n<br /><a href=\\"http://www.mamamusings.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Elizabeth Lawley</a> has taken up the cause with me; being an actual professor, she has more influence than I do, so that should help get this problem fixed.</ins></p>
115	2004-06-18 10:36:53	Comment sanitation	<p>So, <a href=\\"http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/06/17/validation_m/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - mezzoblue - Validation, Moderation, Constipation\\">Dave wants us to share</a> our solutions for fixing bad markup.  I probably should have done this sooner.</p>\n<break/>\n<p>My site has two different systems for fixing markup: a simple function that does basic sanitization on plaintext, and a far more complicated code block that, theoretically, can force even hideously mangled line noise into valid XHTML.  Let&#8217;s look at the function first:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>function sanitizeText($text) {\n  $retval = \\"\\";\n  for ($i = 0; $i &lt; strlen($text); $i++) {\n    $ch = substr($text, $i, 1);\n    switch(ord($ch)) {\n      case 60:        // &lt;\n        $retval .= \\"&amp;lt;\\";\n        break;\n      case 62:        // &gt;\n        $retval .= \\"&amp;gt;\\";\n        break;\n      case 38:        // &amp;\n        $retval .= \\"&amp;amp;\\";\n        break;\n      default:\n        if (ord($ch) &lt;= 127) {\n          $retval .= $ch;\n        }\n        else {\n          $retval .= \\"&amp;#\\" . ord($ch) . \\";\\";\n        }\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n  return addslashes($retval);\n}</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>Basically, this function does a simple character-by-character check to fix entities.  PHP has a function that theoretically does this for you, but it can produce inconsistent results.  My function escapes &lt; to &amp;lt;, &gt; to &amp;gt;, &amp; to &amp;amp;, and any character outside the basic 127 that are the same in virtually every character set to an ordinal <acronym title=\\"HyperText Markup Language\\">HTML</acronym> entity.  For example, &#8217; (that&#8217;s a proper apostrophe) becomes &amp;#8217;.  This function may or may not be useful, if you can get the built-in PHP functions to work, and it can&#8217;t handle text with tags in it.</p>\n<p>So how do you sanitize comment text while preserving some basic HTML tags?  That&#8217;s what this big monster is for:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>// Start out parsing the comment text\n$posttext = stripslashes($_POST[\\"comment\\"]);\n$posttext = strip_tags($posttext, \\"&lt;a&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;&lt;acronym&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;\\");\n$posttext = preg_replace(\\"/\\\\n\\\\r?\\\\s+\\\\n\\\\r?/\\",\\"&lt;/p&gt;\\\\n&lt;p&gt;\\", $posttext);  // Fix up paragraphs\n$posttext = preg_replace(\\"/\\\\n\\\\r?([^&lt;])/\\",\\"\\\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\1\\", $posttext);  // Fix up line breaks\n\n// This fixes any non-ASCII characters but leaves tags intact.\n$reptext = \\"\\";\nfor ($i = 0; $i &lt; strlen($posttext); $i++) {\n  $ch = substr($posttext, $i, 1);\n  if (ord($ch) &lt;= 127) {\n    $reptext .= $ch;\n  }\n  else {\n    $reptext .= \\"&amp;#\\" . ord($ch) . \\";\\";\n  }\n}\n$posttext = $reptext;\n\n// Now we send the comment through Tidy to make sure it\\'s valid XHTML\n$STARTID = \\"PUTSOMESTUFFHERE\\";\n$ENDID = \\"PUTSOMEOTHERSTUFFHERE\\";\n$newtext = \\"\\";\n$descriptors = array(0 =&gt; array(\\"pipe\\", \\"r\\"),                // stdin\n                     1 =&gt; array(\\"pipe\\", \\"w\\"),                // stdout\n                     2 =&gt; array(\\"file\\", \\"/dev/null\\", \\"a\\"));  // stderr\n$process = proc_open(\\"./tidy -asxml -ascii -q --wrap 0\\", $descriptors, $pipes);\nif (is_resource($process)) {\n  fwrite($pipes[0], \\"&lt;p&gt;$STARTID\\\\n\\");\n  fwrite($pipes[0], $posttext);\n  fwrite($pipes[0], \\"\\\\n$ENDID&lt;/p&gt;\\");\n  fclose($pipes[0]);\n\n  while (!feof($pipes[1])) {\n    $newtext .= fgets($pipes[1], 1024);\n  }\n  fclose($pipes[1]);\n\n  $return_value = proc_close($process);\n}\nelse {\n  disp_error(\\"Error processing your comment - please report this to the site administrator.\\");\n}\n\n$start = strpos($newtext, $STARTID) + strlen($STARTID);\n$end = strlen($newtext) - strpos($newtext, $ENDID);\n$posttext = substr($newtext, $start, -$end);\n$posttext = addslashes($posttext);</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>Looks painful, doesn&#8217;t it?  I&#8217;ll go through it peice by peice.</p>\n<p>The first block takes in the text from the form and stores it in a temporary variable for easy access.  I use PHP&#8217;s built-in <code>strip_tags</code> function to strip out any undesired HTML tags, and then apply regular expressions to convert newlines to &lt;br /&gt;s and text blocks with a blank line in between them to paragraphs.</p>\n<p>The next block is a simpler version of the first function I showed you.  This version does not convert ampersands and angle brackets, since some tags are allowed.  If the comment includes a link, for example, this version of the function will not remove the link.</p>\n<p>The second-to-last block is where the comment text is sanitized into valid <acronym title=\\"eXtensible HyperText Markup Language\\">XHTML</acronym>&#8212;and yes, I cheated here.  :-D The text gets run through <a href=\\"http://tidy.sourceforge.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">HTML Tidy</a>, a standalone program.  It&#8217;s much faster and simpler than trying to do it in PHP, although it does introduce an external dependency.</p>\n<p>In order to use Tidy, I first put unique strings at the beginning and end of the text.  If someone happens to enter these strings in a comment, the comment will get cut off and may become invalid, but sufficiently unusual strings should reduce this possibility (note that the strings in the sample code are NOT the ones I actually use).  Then the comment text gets run through Tidy, which unfortunately wraps it in a full XHTML page, DOCTYPE and all.  That&#8217;s what the strings are for&#8212;when you get the result back from Tidy, cut off everything before the start string and after the end string (the first three lines of the last block), and you get just the plain comment text.  The very last line adds slashes before quotes so the text can be stored in my MySQL database.</p>\n<p>So there you have it.  I won&#8217;t claim that this system is perfect, but I&#8217;ve thrown plenty of stuff at it, including Sam Ruby&#8217;s famous I&ntilde;t&euml;rn&acirc;ti&ocirc;n&agrave;liz&aelig;ti&oslash;n, and it handles it.  Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>P.S. Of course, I don&#8217;t have this system for my news posts, because I think I know XHTML.  Note to self: code samples are part of the XHTML too.</p>

117	2004-06-18 22:31:14	Blogroll redux	Now that I&#8217;m doing the 8-to-5 life, I&#8217;ve taken to spending the first hour or so at work catching up on weblogs; this is somewhat justified, as a lot of the blogs I read will post technical articles, which applies directly to my job as a webdesigner (yes, I know I haven&#8217;t posted about the job yet; I&#8217;ll get around to it).  As a result, I&#8217;ve picked up a few new sites and tired of a few old ones, so my blogroll has been updated.  The new sites are <a href=\\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Andy Clarke\\">And all that malarkey</a>, <a href=\\"http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - D.

118	2004-06-22 11:45:17	Best Practices	<p>Warning: this is a big, long article, possibly the longest I&#8217;ve yet written.  I also think it goes over some issues that are very important to the web design and development community, and I hope you&#8217;ll take the time to read it through.</p>\n<break/>\n<h4>Best Practices</h4>\n<p>There seems to be a recent flurry of activity around the website development community.  The first item is <a href=\\"http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/06/11/bestPractice\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Simon Willison: Embracing Best Practice\\">Simon suggesting</a> that we adopt the term &#8220;best practice&#8221; when dealing with web development.  I agree with him that we need to be thinking in broader terms, not just about validation or semantic-ness, but about usability and user interaction and client satisfaction.  As a software engineer, I can look around my industry and see what the web development community may look like in a decade or two, and moving to the concept of best practices is an important one&#8212;although software engineers are still debating what, exactly, a best practice is.  Web development needs to move from lower-level thinking, along the lines of fancy new CSS tricks, to higher-level thinking, dealing with the development process and website architechture, before the industry can mature.</p>\n<h4>State of the Industry</h4>\n<p>The second item is <a href=\\"http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2004/06/16/contest.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Dan Cederholm&#8217;s book contest</a> that resulted in 485 links to various articles and websites about web development.  <a href=\\"http://www.orderedlist.com/articles/simple_list\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - OrderedList - Simple List\\">Steve Smith</a> and <a href=\\"http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2004/06/21/bonanza.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - SimpleBits - Web Standards Link Bonanza\\">Dan himself</a> have compiled these links into lists, which may be the most comprehensive directory of web development articles out there right now.  This is a good thing, because it clearly shows how active the web development community is, and it provides a great quantity of information to help developers, but there&#8217;s a problem.</p>\n<p>The problem, as <a href=\\"http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/06/17/validation_m/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - mezzoblue - Validation, Moderation, Constipation\\">Dave Shea realized</a>, is that there is very little centralization.  The web development community is sort of sprawled about, and right now, the best way to keep track of it all is to read the weblogs of those at the forefront.  This works now, but what happens when the industry expands?  What happens if the third world leapfrogs traditional telecommunications and dives directly into the Internet, as some countries have already done?  Someday, the number of people with Internet access will be measured in the billions, and web development could be a full-fledged international industry.  When there are thousands or millions of web developers, reading everyone&#8217;s weblog isn&#8217;t going to work anymore.</p>\n<h4>Looking for Guidance</h4>\n<p>How can we deal with this?  This is where the community must reflect and choose a solution.  I have a hard time believing there isn&#8217;t an existing organization that can rise up to become a central institution in the web development community, to help set best practices and drive maturation of web development.  <a href=\\"http://www.w3c.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - the World Wide Web Consortium\\">The W3C</a> is a fairly obvious choice, although it requires them to expand beyond simply writing technical specifications to attack the problems of development process and the actual implementation and use of the standards they create.</p>\n<h4>A Central Repository</h4>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say any more about this &#8220;future of the industry&#8221; business.  I&#8217;m primarily a software engineer, not a web developer, so it&#8217;s not really my place to say.  However, I also agree with Dave that in the short term, the community needs some sort of a central repository for web standards and best practices; a place for articles, tutorials, forums, code snippets, news, and so forth.  There are already a variety of sites that do some of this, such as <a href=\\"http://www.alistapart.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">A List Apart</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.cre8asite.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Cre8asite</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://css-discuss.incutio.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">CSS-Discuss</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.cssvault.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">CSS Vault</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">CSS Zen Garden</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.digital-web.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Digital Web Magazine</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.evolt.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Evolt</a>, \n<a href=\\"http://www.hiveminds.info/phpBB/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">HiveMinds</a>, and the \n<a href=\\"http://www.wdvl.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Web Developer&#8217;s Virtual Library\\">WDVL</a>.  The problem is, none of these sites seem to offer the complete package, none of them have very much info on server-side processing, and none of them is The Central Source.</p>\n<h4>How to Build It?</h4>\n<p>In the comments to Dave&#8217;s article, many people expressed an interest in having one site where they can go for everything they need, including code samples for both front-end and back-end work.  Well, the only way this will work is if there is only one site; otherwise, the entire purpose is defeated.  And we need wide, serious support from the big movers and shakers: Jeffery Zeldman, Doug Bowman, Dan Cederholm, Paul Scrivens, Dave Shea, Andrei Herasimchuk, Shaun Inman, Cameron Moll, Mark Pilgrim, Didier Hilhorst, Matt Mullenweg, Jon Hicks, and the list goes on and on.  Without a full lineup of big names focusing their effort, I doubt any one site can become a singular source for the web development community.</p>\n<p>Now, perhaps the community doesn&#8217;t want a single source; monopolies can be dangerous, after all.  But then, how many sources should there be?  2?  3?  5?  10?  A dozen?  A hundred?  I do have some discomfort about the idea, but web development needs a unified voice, and that is tough to accomplish when the community is fractured among different sites.  Of course, to create a site like this requires organization; and the ideal organization would be a website like this, so we wind up in a M&#246;bius strip of organizing the organization.  The next best option would be to have one person set up temporary forums and/or a wiki to use for developing the eventual repository.  I am willing to do this, but to simply nominate myself feels too egotistical, especially since I&#8217; not a very big fish in the pond of web development.</p>\n<h4>The Issues</h4>\n<p>Thus, we come back to the community, which must ask itself a few questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How important is the concept of best practices and the maturity of the industry?</li>\n<li>Do we want a single website/organization to speak for and regulate the industry?</li>\n<li>If so, is there an existing organization that will fit the bill?  Or do we need a new organization?</li>\n<li>Do we want a single website to be a repository of the community&#8217;s collective knowledge?</li>\n<li>If so, is there an existing website that can fill this roll?  Or do we need a new one?</li>\n<li>If we need a new one, who will lead its development?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe these are the issues that the community must reach consensus on, or risk stunting the growth of the industry.  I have answered these questions as best I can, but I will not pretend my answers are the only ones, or even that &#8220;correct&#8221; answers exist.  But I do believe the community needs to sort out these issues, and when it does, it will emerge stronger and more unified, with a clear path ahead of it.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe I&#8217;m completely, utterly wrong.  I leave it to the community to decide.</p>

121	2004-07-21 10:55:47	Someone Take This Shovel	<p>So, I haven&#8217;t made a post in, what, three and a half weeks?  And it turns out that 90% of the work I did for my job isn&#8217;t what my boss actually wanted me to do, so I get to scrap it and start over.  Plus the design I created isn&#8217;t really that great anyways.  And there&#8217;s a mistake I made this morning that I&#8217;m rapidly trying to erase from my memory.  I seem to have dug myself quite a hole of self-despair (hence the title).  Waking up at 6am to go work for eight hours just isn&#8217;t working for me; it seems like all I can do is catch up on what happened during the day, and then I have to go to sleep again.  I&#8217;m a night owl, and this is a day job, and it&#8217;s just shot my mind to hell.  Every day I think &#8220;well, tomorrow I can do things a little differently and it&#8217;ll work out much better&#8221; and then tomorrow is exactly like today&#8230;  I guess I can slug it out for another two and a half weeks, when the co-op ends, and hopefully get credit for it, but what then?  I seem to be cursed with a need for more sleep than most people, and I always have a hard time waking up in the morning, and a hard time falling asleep at night, so it seems like I&#8217;m always more tired than my parents, even though they get <del>more</del><ins datetime=\\"2004-07-27T11:10:00-05:00\\">less (oops, must have been tired when I wrote this)</ins> sleep.  How the hell can I do this all year for 30 years after I graduate?  &#8230;</p>\n<p>Sorry to go all LiveJournal on you, but I just needed to vent some frustration.  I&#8217;ve got a couple of fairly long posts sitting around that need to be cleaned up before I post them, and an OPML file for my blogroll (which has been slowly changing), and the About section is wrong, and the Programming section is all kinds of empty, but I need something to do when I retire.</p>\n<p>If I can make it to August 6th, I&#8217;ll live.</p>

123	2004-07-26 16:01:09	I Have Put Down The Shovel	<p>Feeling a bit better now; after a weekend of hurting myself while doing roofing work, a desk job is a welcome chance to sit for several hours straight.  I&#8217;ve written a bunch of stuff over the past few days, so I&#8217;m going to break it down and post it in parts.</p>\n<p>So, what happened during the three or four weeks I forgot to post?  Well, the most significant event was my aunt and uncle who live in North Carolina coming up to stay with us for a 10-day vacation.  It was nice getting to hang out with them and see some friends of the family, although the job kept me from seeing them as much as I&#8217;d hoped.</p>\n<p>The other significant news is that I am definitely going to <a href=\\"http://www.quakecon.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"OMG DOOM 3 OMG\\">QuakeCon</a> this year.  Plane tickets are already booked, and my friends have a hotel room reserved.  I leave on August 11th and get back on the 16th, so it should make for a nice long weekend.  QuakeCon should absolutely kick ass; 4 days of gaming and junk food and never going outside (it&#8217;s a gaming convention, in Texas, in August&#8212;we won&#8217;t even <em>see</em> sunlight), plus I get to meet a whole bunch of guys I&#8217;ve known online for years, plus <acronym title=\\"Oh My God\\">OMG</acronym> DOOM 3 OMG and it should be a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Of course, the weekend before that, my parents and I are going to <a href=\\"http://www.mosport.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Mosport International Raceway\\">Mosport</a> for the <acronym title=\\"American Le Mans Series\\">ALMS</acronym> race there, which should be fun as always.  It&#8217;s too bad we only have enough time to go to one race a year, but the ALMS is usually entertaining.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t recall anything else happening recently (except for the aforementioned roofing work), which is probably more the fault of my poor memory than a lack of things actually occurring.  As for the website, it&#8217;s been getting small changes; the Music section in the menu got merged into Site info, the blogroll has been changing slightly and now has an OPML version, and the About page has been updated a bit.  More changes are coming, eventually.</p>\n<p>P.S. The title of this post is actually a play on &#8220;I Have Put Out The Light,&#8221; a really awesome song by James Holden.  I&#8217;ll share it if anyone requests it.</p>
124	2004-07-26 21:57:14	Unpredictable won&#8217;t bother anymore	<p>More changes, which may or may not stay: following <a href=\\"http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/07/23/redesign-time-presentation/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - 1976design: Redesign explained\\">Dunstan&#8217;s lead</a>, I switched the front page to use &#8220;humanized&#8221; post times and the time since the post was made.  Archive pages still use the old format.  I haven&#8217;t decided which one I prefer, so this may change randomly.  I changed the count of comments and trackbacks to be a single count of &#8220;replies,&#8221; which should make things simpler.  I added a link to the menu for <a href=\\"/news/latest/\\">latest replies</a>, which has been around for a while but never linked from anywhere.  I moved <a href=\\"/about/blogroll/\\">the blogroll</a> to its own page, making room for one of those linklogs that seems to be so popular.  It&#8217;s still under construction, so bear with me.</p>\n<p>Any comments on the changes?  I could go either way on some of them, so hopefully the four people that read my site will have an opinion.</p>\n<p>By the way, this time the post title is courtesy of <cite>Andain - Beautiful Things (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix)</cite>.</p>
125	2004-07-27 11:04:44	An Issue Needing Resolution	<p>I was pointed to <a href=\\"http://www.scantips.com/no72dpi.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Say No to 72dpi\\">Say No to 72<acronym title=\\"dots per inch\\">dpi</acronym></a> via <a href=\\"http://www.cameronmoll.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Authentic Boredom\\">Cameron Moll</a>&#8217;s sidebar.  It&#8217;s an interesting article, albiet with a <a href=\\"http://www.bancomicsans.com/home.html\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Ban Comic Sans\\">poor font choice</a>, but it has a misconception in a data table that I need to address.  This has become so widespread that I&#8217;m going to use inline styles to highlight its importance:</p>\n<p><big>Do not use 1280x1024 resolution.</big></p>\n<p>The only time you should use 1280x1024 is if it is the <em>native</em> resolution of an <acronym title=\\"Liquid Crystal Display\\">LCD</acronym> monitor.  If you are using a <acronym title=\\"Cathode Ray Tube\\">CRT</acronym> monitor, <strong>do not use 1280x1024</strong>.  Why?  I&#8217;ll do my best to explain it.</p>\n<p>Monitors have something called an <dfn>aspect ratio</dfn>.  This is the ratio between the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the monitor, and determines whether the monitor is more square-shaped or more rectangular.  Virtually all CRT monitors and many LCD monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio, which means if you divide the horizontal size by the vertical size, you will get (roughly) 4/3, or 1.333333333&#8230; repeating.</p>\n<p>Screen resolutions also have their own aspect ratio, which is <em>independent</em> of the aspect ratio of the monitor.  Fortunately, most popular resolutions (800x600, 1024x768, 1152x864, 1600x1200, etc.) are also a 4:3 aspect ratio, so when you display them on a 4:3 monitor, everything looks normal.  Here is the problem: <strong>1280x1024 is not a 4:3 resolution</strong>.  It is, in fact, <em>5:4</em>.  Thus, if you use 1280x1024 on a normal 4:3 ratio monitor (most CRTs are 4:3), everything will be squished vertically because the aspect ratios are different.  There is no way around this; if your monitor is 4:3, the resolution you want is 1280x960, <strong>not</strong> 1280x1024.</p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s more complicated than this.  Many new LCD monitors have a native resolution of 1280x1024.  This means that the monitor itself is now a 5:4 ratio, so <em>regular resolutions will be wrong</em>.  800x600, 1024x768, 1152x864, 1600x1200, none of these will display properly.  Confusing things even more, there are now widescreen monitors, which are completely different from both 4:3 and 5:4.</p>\n<p>I used to run 1280x1024 on a 19&#8243; CRT monitor, and didn&#8217;t realize it was wrong, but when I switched to 1280x960 it was immediately obvious how everything had been squished.  You may not want to give up that extra vertical screen space, but trust me: using the correct aspect ratio is worth a little real estate.</p>\n<p>So, how do you figure out what the aspect ratio of your monitor is?  First, try checking the manufacturer&#8217;s website or your manual.  Do <em>not</em> trust on-screen displays&#8212;my 19&#8243; monitor lists 1280x1024 as a &#8220;preferred&#8221; resolution, even though it is dead wrong.  If you have a ruler handy, just taking measurements may be the quickest way, and it is probably the most reliable.  Divide the horizontal length by the vertical length, and hopefully you&#8217;ll get a number close to either 4/3 or 5/4.  If it is 4/3, use 4:3 resolutions like 1024x768, 1280x960, or 1600x1200.  If it is 5/4, use 5:4 resolutions like 1280x1024 or 1600x1280.  If it is something completely different, you probably have a widescreen monitor, and God help you because they don&#8217;t seem to be standardized; you&#8217;ll have to do some research to see what works for widescreens.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will save a few people from using the wrong aspect ratio, and leave you less confused than you were before you started reading.</p>

I was considering a larger-scale redesign, and may still do one later, but this was enough of an improvement for me to hold off on any major changes.  I&#8217;ll probably wait until after QuakeCon (which is also after my co-op should end), at which point I plan on starting a new windows install on my desktop, and then I&#8217;ll go ahead and do a more significant website redesign.  I&#8217;ve considered switching to a packaged weblog system, but I probably won&#8217;t.  We&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>\n<p>What brought this on?  Well, <a href=\\"http://www.maniacalrage.net/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Maniacal Rage: Senseless acts of writing\\">Garrett Murray</a> is vying for <a href=\\"http://9rules.com/whitespace/whitespace/first_ever_whitespace_awards.php\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Whitespace: First Ever Whitespace Awards\\">Justin Goodlett&#8217;s title</a> by redesigning <em>again</em>.  Relatively minor changes, but his site still looks excellent.  I notice he now uses relative dates on the front page and actual dates everywhere else, the same as I do, although he did it intentionally, whereas I did it because I was too lazy to go mucking around in the archives script again, but as long as someone else thought it was a good idea, I&#8217;ll stick with it.  I&#8217;ll definitely have to steal that quicksearch thing he has and work it into The Multisearch Box&#8482;.</p>
127	2004-07-28 21:41:58	Cult-o-licious	<p>Photo Matt recently <a href=\\"http://photomatt.net/2004/07/18/a-foot-of-mac/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Photo Matt: A Foot of Mac\\">joined the cult of the Mac</a>.  I&#8217;ve considered doing this before, but it&#8217;s hard to justify the expense of a PowerBook&#8212;or even an iBook&#8212;when I already have a perfectly usable laptop.  Also, I&#8217;ve heard many nasty things about problems with Apple&#8217;s hardware and tech support, plus the whole shamozzle surrounding Konfabulator/Dashboard, plus the whole scary cult thing.  I&#8217;m no Windows advocate, but XP Pro seems pretty stable, and <a href=\\"http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2003/10/16/its-all-about-the-bling-bling/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Binary Bonsai: It&#8217;s all about the Bling Bling\\">you can hack it</a> to make it look <a href=\\"http://www.aquaxp.com/theme/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - AquaXP\\">almost exactly like OS X</a> if you want.</p>\n<p>Even so, I&#8217;d still want a Mac laptop except for one stupid, little thing: they only have one mouse button.  If a computer doesn&#8217;t have two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel, I can&#8217;t use it.  Command-click is not a right mouse button.  Click and drag is not a scroll wheel.  The arrow keys are not a scroll wheel.  I know, this is absolutely the oldest and possibly dumbest reason people give for not using a Mac, but you can&#8217;t just replace the mouse on a laptop, and a mouse without a scroll wheel is like a keyboard without a space bar.  I can handle Mac OS X and find hacks to make it work how I want, but I can&#8217;t change the hardware, so I&#8217;ll stick with my current laptop for now.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m on the topic of computer hardware, I&#8217;m considering replacing my old <a href=\\"http://www.samsung.com/au/products/monitors/discontinuedmodels/950p.asp\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Samsung SyncMaster 950p</a> monitor with a new <acronym title=\\"Cathode Ray Tube\\">CRT</acronym> or <acronym title=\\"Liquid Crystal Display\\">LCD</acronym>.  The problem is, I happen to be a fairly avid computer gamer, and I play first-person shooters a fair amount.  These games depend on the ability to react quickly to what you see, and to do that you need a very responsive monitor that doesn&#8217;t have smearing issues, which rules out all but the most expensive LCDs, and I can&#8217;t really afford the models that are left over.  However, instead of dropping a lot of money on <a href=\\"http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-1578&amp;category_id=4009\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Dell 2001FP 20-inch LCD\\">a high-end LCD</a>, I could spend a lot less on <a href=\\"http://www.necmitsubishi.com/products/ProductDetail.cfm?Product=215&amp;ClassificationFamily=1&amp;Classification=1\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - NEC MultiSync FE2111SB 22-inch CRT\\">an even higher-end CRT</a> which would be a better monitor and would definitely not suffer from the quirks of an LCD, but it would take up a huge amount of desk space, be difficult to transport, and be very heavy.  Does anyone know of an LCD under $500 that is a 4:3 aspect ratio (remember, <a href=\\"http://wadny.com/news/during/2004/7/27/1104/\\" title=\\"An Issue Needing Resolution\\">5:4 ratio is bad</a>), does at least 1280x960 resolution, and can handle a modern shooter like Unreal Tournament 2004?  If not, it looks like I&#8217;ll be looking for someone with a forklift to borrow.</p>

Shortly thereafter, <a href=\\"http://www.zeldman.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens a new window - Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report\\">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> offered <a href=\\"http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0704e.shtml\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Jeffrey Zeldman: Only defenestrate\\">his comments on the article</a>, where he praises it for being short and full of useful content.  Unfortunately, he misses an opportunity to simplify the message even further.  Stealing an idea from Fark (which stole it from a movie), I have managed to reduce Doug&#8217;s article to a mere <em>seven words</em>.  Here they are:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Old and busted: tables.

She&#8217;s maybe 4, and she&#8217;s talking on a <em>bloody cell phone</em>.  Goshdarnit, when I was a kid, all we had were phones with cords and they were tethered to the wall and our cars didn&#8217;t even have air conditioning and the TV had maybe a dozen channels and we didn&#8217;t have none of this high-falutin&#8217; <em>In-tar-net</em>&#8230; sigh.

I crack myself up), the complete, true story of how we got two free laptops (totalling about $2500) from <acronym title=\\"Hewlett-Packard\\">HP</acronym>/Compaq.  Click &#8220;Read more...&#8221; to see the story.</p>\n<break/>\n<h4>The Beginning</h4>\n<p>It all started a few billion years ago, when the first amino acids combined to form&#8230; wait, too far.  The relevant story begins a little less than two years ago, back in September of 2002, before my first year of college.  I figured that a laptop might be handy to take notes on and such, so we (my parents and I) went out and found a cheap Compaq laptop that looked reasonable.  We might have gotten a better one, but at the time I had also just ordered a brand new Alienware desktop to replace my aging 900MHz Thunderbird.  As it turns out, the Alienware was even crappier than the laptop; it killed a video card, a motherboard, and two CD burners before I finally built a replacement machine myself, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>\n<h4>The First Signs</h4>\n<p>The laptop seemed to work fine for a while&#8212;perhaps a few months&#8212;before I noticed that the trackpad wasn&#8217;t working so well anymore.  And it kept getting worse, eventually breaking completely (conveniently before a presentation in class I was going to use the laptop for).  We sent it back for repairs, which fixed the problem.  Or so we thought.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, I never used the laptop very much, yet the trackpad started failing again.  With the warranty about to expire and a problem resurfacing, we bought an extension on the warranty and sent the laptop back for a second round of repairs.</p>\n<h4>Houston, We&#8217;ve Got a Lemon</h4>\n<p>It turned out to be a wise choice to get the warranty, as the trackpad started failing again, along with the CD drive.  Despite virtually no use, the laptop had broken again.  In fact, the CD drive may have broken twice; somewhere along the way, I lost track.  Regardless, this laptop was now underpowered, overweight, and breaking repeatedly.  I was ready to send it back for a last round of repairs and then sell it on eBay and cut our losses, but my dad decided to send a nasty e-mail to HP&#8217;s <acronym title=\\"Chief Executive Officer\\">CEO</acronym> first.  A lucky decision, that.</p>\n<h4>A Turn for the Better</h4>\n<p>After a short wait, my dad got a reply back from HP&#8212;and they offered to send us a brand new, replacement laptop, for free!  Needless to say, we were interested.  My dad (I was still at school at the time, so I couldn&#8217;t take care of any of this) got on the phone with them and they offered us an R3000Z, which we accepted.  At some point, they tried to change their minds and give us a lower model, but my dad didn&#8217;t let them pull that trick.  It took them nearly a month to ship the R3000Z (specifically, an R3140US) to us, but when it finally arrived it was much more impressive than the old laptop.  Probably an order of magnitude faster, with a combo DVD+R/RW and CD-R/RW burner, 15.4&#8243; widescreen display, and a much more solid construction than the old laptop.  I&#8217;ve subjected it to more use in the few months that I&#8217;ve had it than I gave the old laptop in two years, and the new one has held up nicely&#8212;it&#8217;s even my primary machine at work.</p>\n<h4>&#8230;But Wait, There&#8217;s More</h4>\n<p>This is where the story takes a weird twist.  Maybe a month or so after the R3000Z came in, I came home one day and my mom announced that there was a package on the front porch from Compaq.  I brought it in and opened it up and inside was&#8212;another laptop.  Huh?  I looked at the packing list, and yup, it&#8217;s to be a laptop&#8212;shipped overnight.  From SHANGHAI.  I still can&#8217;t understand how you can accidentally send something halfway around the world overnight&#8212;the shipping alone would have been several hundred dollars&#8212;but they did.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, there&#8217;s a <a href=\\"http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/products/unorderd.htm\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - Federal Trade Commission: Unordered Merchandise\\">law on the books</a> that says unordered merchandise is automatically yours (thanks for the tip, Paul!).  Apparently it was made after companies came up with a scam where they send you unordered merchandise and then tell you to either pay for it or return it&#8212;at your expense.  This isn&#8217;t exactly what the law was passed for, but it means the second laptop is legally ours.  It&#8217;s an X1000 series (an X1360US, to be precise), which is actually more expensive than the R3000Z, and the particular model we got is worth nearly $1600.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>So, although it took nearly two years, we got two brand-new laptops worth maybe $2500 together for only about $900 (the cost of the original laptop).  If Alienware had handled this as well as HP/Compaq has, I might be willing to buy from them again.  Also, the quality of these two new laptops is definitely much better than the old one was.  The new ones are solidly built and seem to hold up well, with no issues so far.  The R3160 can even play Unreal Tournament 2004 at good frame rates, something the old laptop would have failed at miserably.</p>\n<p>A quick note to businesses: this is the point of customer support, to turn an unhappy customer into a happy customer, and HP/Compaq succeeded admirably.</p>
131	2004-08-05 10:42:47	Vacation, Part I	<p>Tomorrow morning, my parents and I leave for <a href=\\"http://www.mosport.com/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">Mosport International Raceway</a> for a weekend of racing, featuring the American Le Mans Series and Speed World Challenge.  This means I won&#8217;t have access to anything even vaguely resembling the Internet, so there won&#8217;t be any posts for a few days.  Of course, next week is <a href=\\"http://www.quakecon.org/\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window\\">QuakeCon</a>, so I&#8217;m doing a lot of travelling in the near future; however, QuakeCon should have Internet access, so I&#8217;ll be able to blog from there.</p>\n<p><acronym title=\\"ta ta for now\\">TTFN</acronym>&#8230;</p>
132	2004-08-22 21:40:36	&lt;/vacation&gt;	So, I got back on monday.  QuakeCon kicked ass, people have <a href=\\"http://r1ch.net/images/qcon/2004\\" rel=\\"external\\" title=\\"Opens in a new window - QuakeCon 2004 gallery\\">posted pictures</a>.  I took a few but haven&#8217;t uploaded them yet.  I&#8217;ve been pretty tired lately, and only today finally got around to looking at my blogroll, and I haven&#8217;t been very interested in it.  Maybe after working on web stuff all summer, I&#8217;ve exhausted my interest in it for now.  Look for at least several more days of silence here, and maybe I&#8217;ll get back into posting.
