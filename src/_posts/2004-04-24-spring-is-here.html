title: Spring is here
---
<p>Well, spring has been here for a while now, so I decided it was time to update my header image. I couldn’t bear to
    colorize that sky, so I made the header and footer blue and the sidebar yellow. I may begin rotating header images
    more frequently, if I can find some nature around here. I also stuck some borders in the sidebar to help clearly
    delineate each section.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go into your blog’s archives.</li>
    <li>Find your 23rd post (or closest to).</li>
    <li>Find the fifth sentence (or closest to).</li>
    <li>Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>My <a href="/news/during/2001/07/19/" title="Still recovering">23<sup>rd</sup> post</a> is rather
    simple, so I’ll paste it in entirety:</p>
<blockquote cite="/news/during/2001/07/19/">
    <p>The old news database files are saved, but I need a way to convert them into plaintext or somehow get them into
        this server, so the news will be missing for a while. Sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, the sentence I would paste would be <q>Sorry.</q> but that seemed kind of silly.</p>
