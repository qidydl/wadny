title: Updated RSS feed
---
Well, I’ve been doing craploads of stuff here at RIT, and I haven’t had much motivation or time to update the site, but I just wanted to note that my RSS feed has been updated to RSS version 2.0 and is now validated, which should make all none of you using news aggregators to read my site quite happy.

General status, for anyone who’s wondering: classes are either boring or interesting, the people here are fun, and Warcraft III has devoured my soul.
