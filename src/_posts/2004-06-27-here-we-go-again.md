[FastCompany](http://www.fastcompany.com/){:rel='external'} is [trying to follow](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/26/fastcompanys_terribl.html "Boing Boing: FastCompany’s terrible linking policy"){:rel='external'} in the footsteps of [KPMG](http://boingboing.net/2001/12/05/reason_4332442_not_t.html "Boing Boing: Reason 4,332,442 not to ask"){:rel='external'}, [Starbucks](http://boingboing.net/2002/03/23/starbucks_as_clueles.html "Boing Boing: Starbucks as clueless as KPMG?"){:rel='external'}, and [NPR](http://boingboing.net/2002/06/18/nprs_brutally_stupid.html "Boing Boing: NPR’s brutally stupid linking policy"){:rel='external'} (also see [my previous coverage]({% post_url 2002-06-20-updates-on-lots-of-things %} "Updates on lots of things")). Attention FastCompany: you do not own the Internet. [Stop deluding yourselves](http://www.fastcompany.com/about/contact.html "FastCompany Contacts and Customer Service"){:rel='external'}. Oh, and someone needs to tell [Sellotape](http://www.sellotape.co.uk/copyright.htm "Sellotape Copyright Information"){:rel='external'} too, before they make idiots out of themselves (whoops, too late, they’ve been BoingBoinged). I happen to take the opposite belief that BoingBoing does: they think <q cite="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/26/fastcompanys_terribl.html">FC’s credibility as an authority on the Web lends credence to this bizarre and damaging idea of needing permission to link,</q> whereas I think it simply makes FC look like a bunch of idiots, and guarantees I will never believe anything they say without solid proof and peer approval. Good work FC, you’ve just ruined your reputation.
