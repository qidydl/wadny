title: Cult-o-licious

Photo Matt recently [joined the cult of the Mac](http://photomatt.net/2004/07/18/a-foot-of-mac/ "Photo Matt: A Foot of Mac"){:rel='external'}. I’ve considered doing this before, but it’s hard to justify the expense of a PowerBook—or even an iBook—when I already have a perfectly usable laptop. Also, I’ve heard many nasty things about problems with Apple’s hardware and tech support, plus the whole shamozzle surrounding Konfabulator/Dashboard, plus the whole scary cult thing. I’m no Windows advocate, but XP Pro seems pretty stable, and [you can hack it](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2003/10/16/its-all-about-the-bling-bling/ "Binary Bonsai: It’s all about the Bling Bling"){:rel='external'} to make it look [almost exactly like OS X](http://www.aquaxp.com/theme/ "AquaXP"){:rel='external'} if you want.

Even so, I’d still want a Mac laptop except for one stupid, little thing: they only have one mouse button. If a computer doesn’t have two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel, I can’t use it. Command-click is not a right mouse button. Click and drag is not a scroll wheel. The arrow keys are not a scroll wheel. I know, this is absolutely the oldest and possibly dumbest reason people give for not using a Mac, but you can’t just replace the mouse on a laptop, and a mouse without a scroll wheel is like a keyboard without a space bar. I can handle Mac OS X and find hacks to make it work how I want, but I can’t change the hardware, so I’ll stick with my current laptop for now.

While I’m on the topic of computer hardware, I’m considering replacing my old [Samsung SyncMaster 950p](http://www.samsung.com/au/products/monitors/discontinuedmodels/950p.asp){:rel='external'} monitor with a new CRT or LCD. The problem is, I happen to be a fairly avid computer gamer, and I play first-person shooters a fair amount. These games depend on the ability to react quickly to what you see, and to do that you need a very responsive monitor that doesn’t have smearing issues, which rules out all but the most expensive LCDs, and I can’t really afford the models that are left over. However, instead of dropping a lot of money on [a high-end LCD](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-1578&amp;category_id=4009 "Dell 2001FP 20-inch LCD"){:rel='external'}, I could spend a lot less on [an even higher-end CRT](http://www.necmitsubishi.com/products/ProductDetail.cfm?Product=215&amp;ClassificationFamily=1&amp;Classification=1 "NEC MultiSync FE2111SB 22-inch CRT"){:rel='external'} which would be a better monitor and would definitely not suffer from the quirks of an LCD, but it would take up a huge amount of desk space, be difficult to transport, and be very heavy. Does anyone know of an LCD under $500 that is a 4:3 aspect ratio (remember, [5:4 ratio is bad]({% post_url 2004-07-27-an-issue-needing-resolution %} "An Issue Needing Resolution")), does at least 1280x960 resolution, and can handle a modern shooter like Unreal Tournament 2004? If not, it looks like I’ll be looking for someone with a forklift to borrow.
