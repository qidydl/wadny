<p>A man was walking home alone late one night when he hears a</p>
<div class="center">
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
</div>
<br>behind him.
<p>Walking faster he looks back, and makes out the image of an upright coffin banging its way down the middle of the street towards him.</p>
<div class="center">
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
</div>
<p>Terrified, the man begins to run towards his home, the coffin bouncing quickly behind him ...</p>
<div class="center">
<p>faster...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FASTER...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUMP...</p>
</div>
<p>He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him.</p>
<p>However, the coffin crashes through his door, with the lid of the coffin clapping...</p>
<div class="center">
<p>clappity-BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>clappity-BUMP...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>clappity-BUMP...</p>
</div>
<p>on the heels of the terrified man.</p>
<p>Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.</p>
<p>With a loud CRASH the coffin breaks down the door. Bumping and clapping towards him.</p>
<p>The man screams and reaches for something, anything... but all he can find is a bottle of cough syrup!</p>
<p>Desperate, he throws the cough syrup at the coffin...</p>
<p>... the coffin stops.</p>
