title: March 18, 2000 - Crime doesn't pay
---
<h2>ANN ARBOR IDIOT</h2>
<p>The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 8:50 AM, flashed a gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down
   because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man,
   frustrated, walked away.
<h2>KENTUCKY IDIOTS</h2>
<p>Two men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck.  Instead of pulling the front panel off the
      machine, though, they pulled the bumper off their truck. Scared, they left the scene and drove home...
<br>...with the chain still attached to the machine.
<br>...with their bumper still attached to the chain.
<br>...with their vehicle's license plate still attached to the bumper.</p>
<h2>LOUISIANA IDIOT</h2>
<p>A man walked into a Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in
      the register, which the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20 bill on the counter.  The total amount of cash he got from
      the drawer? $15.00. [If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, was a crime committed?]</p>
<h2>ARKANSAS IDIOT</h2>
<p>Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder
      block and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store
      window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape.</p>
<h2>NEW YORK IDIOT</h2>
<p>As a female shopper exited a convenience store, a man grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was able to give them a detailed description
      of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police had apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and
      told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, "Yes, Officer... that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from."</p>
<h2>SEATTLE IDIOT</h2>
<p>When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find an ill man,
      curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugging his hose into the motor home's
      sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.</p>
