title: Housecleaning

<p>A couple of small changes: I reorganized the stylesheet very slightly so <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>
    should now use the hover effect on links (the underline goes away to indicate link hover), I removed the useless
    class="nb" stuff for the image links at the bottom of the sidebar (along with the corresponding <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) since I can just use selectors to fix them, and I edited the
    little “external link” arrow (which IE users can’t see—sorry, I tried) so it should animate a little more smoothly
    (you can only really notice it on a white background though). Little tiny changes, trying to make the site just that
    little bit better. Of course, there’s a lot of big, obvious stuff I still have to work on. That gets saved for when
    homework is done.</p>
