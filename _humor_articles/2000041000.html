<li>I love deadlines. I especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go flying by.</li>
<li>If swimming is so good for your figure, how do you explain whales?</li>
<li>It's gonna be like threading a needle with a haystack.</li>
<li>The trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat.</li>
<li>Am I getting smart with you? ... How would you know?</li>
<li>The more you run over a dead cat, the flatter it gets.</li>
<li>I loathe people who keep dogs. They are cowards who haven't got the guts to bite people themselves.</li>
<li>I put the "fun" in dysfunctional.</li>
<li>I get plenty of exercise - jumping to conclusions, pushing my luck and dodging deadlines.</li>
<li>On the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the Escape key.</li>
<li>I have not yet begun to procrastinate.</li>
<li>You're slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter.</li>
<li>I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.</li>
<li>Just remember, no matter where you go, there you are.</li>
<li>There are two rules for ultimate success in life: 1. Never tell everything you know.</li>
<li>Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're NOT out to get you...</li>
<li>I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.</li>
<li>When I get to where I'm going, will somebody please tell me where I am?</li>
<li>Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you how to get along without it.</li>
<li>Do not meddle in the affairs of cats, for they are subtle and will whiz on your computer.</li>
<li>Raising teenagers is like nailing Jell-O to a tree.</li>
<li>Reason to smile:  Every seven minutes of every day, someone in an aerobics class pulls a hamstring.</li>
<li>The best way to keep kids at home is to make the home a pleasant atmosphere... and let the air out of their tires. -- Dorothy Parker</li>
<li>Car sickness is the feeling you get when the monthly car payment is due.</li>
<li>Families are like fudge ... Mostly sweet with a few nuts.</li>
<li>Middle age is when you choose your cereal for the fiber, not the toy.</li>
<li>My mind not only wanders, sometimes it leaves completely.</li>
<li>If you can remain calm, you just don't have all the facts.</li>
<li>You know you're getting old when you stoop to tie your shoes and wonder what else you can do while you're down there.</li>
<li>Life's golden age is when the kids are too old to need babysitters and too young to borrow the family car.</li>
