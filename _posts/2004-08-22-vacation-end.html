So, I got back on monday.  QuakeCon kicked ass, people have <a href="http://r1ch.net/images/qcon/2004" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - QuakeCon 2004 gallery">posted pictures</a>.  I took a few but haven’t uploaded them yet.  I’ve been pretty tired lately, and only today finally got around to looking at my blogroll, and I haven’t been very interested in it.  Maybe after working on web stuff all summer, I’ve exhausted my interest in it for now.  Look for at least several more days of silence here, and maybe I’ll get back into posting.
