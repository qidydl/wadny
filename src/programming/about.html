<p>This section contains information on various programs I have written, as well as some basic information on the
    languages they’re written in.</p>

<p>I have been programming seriously since the late 90’s (1997 or so). In high school, I went through a three-year
    course sequence on C++ and decided to become a software engineer. While I studied at <abbr
        title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr> as a Software Engineering major, I took several courses on
    Java; a course on C++; a course covering Lisp, Perl, and Python; and a course on Motorola 68000 assembly language.
    The curriculum also covered at lot of aspects of software engineering not specific to particular languages, like
    design patterns, verification &amp; validation, and project management. After graduating, I spent several years
    mostly doing C++ on Linux at my first job, and now I’ve moved on to primarily C# and the .NET ecosystem, as well as
    <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> and JavaScript.</p>

<p>On my own, I have done a lot of work with PHP and some work with Perl and Python, along with the occasional C++ or
    Java program. I am also familiar with using SQL for accessing databases and using <abbr
        title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</abbr> to design software.</p>
