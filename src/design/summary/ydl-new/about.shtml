  <tr><td><b>HISTORY</b>
    <br>YDL Development used to be a combination of two companies: YDL Webdesign and the IRC Development Team.  I decided that really didn't buy us
      anything, so the two companies are basically one now.  This basically lets me design whatever I want, and not have to worry about where it fits in
      with either company; since I'm getting into C++ programming, at home and at school, it makes things easier when I come up with a cool new idea that
      doesn't have anything to do with IRC or website design.
    <p><b>WHAT WE DO</b>
    <br>YDL Development basically makes whatever is useful for me, but I'll take suggestions for things to create, because I like tinkering with a new idea
      and getting it to work just right.  I've got a script and bot for mIRC as well as a number of existing website designs, and since I'm getting into C++
      and PHP, I'm also creating things like simple console games, news updating scripts, and an easily customizeable script for browsing directories.  If
      you have an idea for something interesting, or something that's normally boring that you want to put a new spin on, give me a shout.
    <p><b>HOW TO JOIN US</b>
    <br>There are instructions for joining YDL Development in the people section.  Bascially, you must have a background in
      programming of some sort - mIRC scripting, HTML, C++, PHP, Perl, Java, or any other language that's relatively modern (no, COBOL doesn't count).  C++
      and HTML are the most important, with web languages (Java, PHP, Perl) following shortly behind, so if you know any of those really well, and can prove
      it, there's a good chance you'll get in.
