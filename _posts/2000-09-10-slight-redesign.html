title: Slight redesign
---
I’ve redesigned the page again. This time, I put the menu on the side so it doesn’t interfere with YDL’s design. I’m going to remove all of the frame-killing code in <abbr title="First-Person Shooter Information Database">FPSID</abbr> so it can open in the frames as well, and then everything should work. You’ll notice the menu also gives the date of the last news post. When I make changes, I’ll update the news, so check that date.
