title: Stupid broken status indicator part II

Ok, I just went ahead and removed the IM status indicator, ICQ is being too broken and Iâ€™m usually online all the time anyway. If you need my screen name or UIN, leave a comment or send an email. I might put that info in the about section sometime, if I remember to.
