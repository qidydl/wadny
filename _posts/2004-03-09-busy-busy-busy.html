title: Busy, busy, busy

<p>So, obviously it’s been a while since my last post.  <acronym title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</acronym> runs on a quarter system (as opposed to a semester system), so we just had exams and a break.  I was too busy during exams to post, and nothing really worth mentioning on here happened during break.</p>
<p>So, that brings us to today—I just updated the design section with a new design (EdgeIRC version 4) and redid all of the thumbnails so you can see the design better.  Jakob Nielsen calls this “<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9611.html" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window: Marginalia of Web Design (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox November 1996)">Relevance-Enhanced Image Reduction</a>;” Jakob Nielsen also uses big words for no apparent reason.  I’d just call it “cropping and resizing,” but maybe that’s why I’m not a so-called “usability expert,” making a bajillion dollars, with a website that looks like it was made by a third-grader.</p>
<p>As long as we’re on the subject of Generally Not-Good Things, Lockergnome has just done <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/web/backissues/20040303.phtml#20040303_1" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window: Lockergnome GNOMEREPORT: Busy Bees In The Hive">the dumbest thing ever</a>: after turning an ugly, old, table-based hack design into a clean, decent-looking standards- and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>-based design, they (for some unfathomable reason) switched back.  This is a slap in the face to countless people who have worked so hard to bring the web out of the tangled mess of nonstandard markup, and it ensures that I will never visit Lockergnome’s site and never believe anything they say again.  Simon Willison <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/03/08/devolution" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window: Simon Willison - Lockergnome reverts">sums it up perfectly</a>: <q cite="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/03/08/devolution">Welcome back to 1996.</q></p>
