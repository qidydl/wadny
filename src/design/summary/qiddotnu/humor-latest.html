	<li>The badness of a movie is directly proportional to the number of helicopters in it.
	<li>You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.
	<li>You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby
	    emerging from her at that moment.
	<li>The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.
	<li>The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that,
            deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above-average drivers.
	<li>There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age 11.
	<li>There is a  fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."
	<li>People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.
	<li>If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential,
            that word would be "meetings."
	<li>The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy people who are not in them.
	<li>If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its glories, and he decides to deliver a message to
            humanity, he will NOT use as his messenger a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle (or, in some cases, really bad makeup too).
	<li>You should not confuse your career with your life.
	<li>A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter or janitor, is not a nice person.
	<li>No matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too seriously
	<li>When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command.
            Very often, that individual is crazy.

      <td background="bg.gif" bgcolor="#046AB1">These are from a book called "Disorder in the Court". These are things people actually said
        in court, word for word, taken down and now published by court reporters - who had the torment of staying calm while these exchanges
        were actually taking place:
	<p>Q: What is your date of birth?
	<br>A: July fifteenth.
	<br>Q: What year?
	<br>A: Every year.
	<p>Q: What gear were you in at the moment of the impact?
	<br>A: Gucci sweats and Reeboks.
	<p>Q: What was the first thing your husband said to you when he woke
	<br>A: He said, "Where am I, Cathy?"
	<br>Q: And why did that upset you?
	<br>A: My name is Susan.
	<p>Q: And where was the location of the accident?
	<br>A: Approximately milepost 499.
	<br>Q: And where is milepost 499?
	<br>A: Probably between milepost 498 and 500.
	<p>Q: Now doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn't know about it until the next morning?
	<p>Q: The youngest son, the twenty-year old, how old is he?
	<p>Q: Were you present when your picture was taken?
	<p>Q: So the date of conception (of the baby) was August 8th?
	<br>A: Yes.
	<br>Q: And what were you doing at that time?
	<p>Q: How was your first marriage terminated?
	<br>A: By death.
	<br>Q: And by whose death was it terminated?
	<p>Q: Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on dead people?
	<br>A: All my autopsies are performed on dead people.
	<p>Q: All your responses must be oral, OK?  What school did you go to?
	<br>A: Oral.
	<p>Q: Do you recall the time that you examined the body?
	<br>A: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m.
	<br>Q: And Mr. Dennington was dead at the time?
	<br>A: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an autopsy.
	<p>Q: Are you qualified to give a urine sample?
	<p>Q: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?
	<br>A: No.
	<br>Q: Did you check for blood pressure?
	<br>A: No.
	<br>Q: Did you check for breathing?
	<br>A: No.
	<br>Q: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?
	<br>A: No.
	<br>Q: How can you be so sure, Doctor?
	<br>A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.
	<br>Q: But could the patient have still been alive nevertheless?
	<br>A: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere.
