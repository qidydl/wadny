title: Friday Five

Two good things: I’m home for the summer (yay summer!) and my playlist is now over 100 hours (almost 103 hours, to be precise).

Holy [buttons](http://gtmcknight.com/buttons/ "lots of buttons"){:rel='external'}, Batman!

[Friday Five:](http://fridayfive.org/ "Five questions to answer every Friday"){:rel='external'}

1. [Colgate Total](http://www.colgate.com/cp/global.class/showcasetool/templates/displayProduct.jsp?catid=12&amp;id=35 "Websites for toothpaste... dear god, what are we coming to?"){:rel='external'}, for no particular reason.
2. Whatever RIT, or, now that I’m back home, my mom, happens to buy.
3. [Merrel](http://www.merrellboot.com/catalog/gallery.asp?NavID=MMOC&amp;nxtpage=1 "I have the Jungle Moc in Taupe"){:rel='external'} moccasin-type things—I got tired of shoelaces.
4. RIT is Pepsi’s little whore, but now that I’m home I stick to orange soda but no particular brand.
5. I used to chew Winterfresh and Icebreakers rather regularly. I have no idea why I started, and no idea why I’ve stopped, but I don’t really chew gum much anymore.
