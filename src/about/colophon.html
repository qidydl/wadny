<p>This page contains basic information about wadny.com itself: information on the markup and standards followed;
    information on the typography used; information on software and programming languages used; and rights and various
    administrivia.</p>
<p>More information, including the history of the site, is available on the <a href="/design/wadny/">wadny.com design
        portfolio page</a>.</p>

<section>
    <h1 id="code">Code and standards</h1>
    <p>Wadny.com is entirely hand-written <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5, <abbr
            title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, all rendered ahead of time using <a
            href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a <a
            href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window - Basic explanation of static site generators">static site
            generator</a>, which is a tool that renders content using templates and layouts to produce simple HTML files
        that require no special processing to serve. This is much simpler and cheaper to host than a site that runs as a
        program and renders dynamically. The content and styles for all pages should be valid, and the buttons in the
        sidebar can be used to validate any page.</p>
    <p>I try to make extensive use of semantic elements, including proper headings, acronyms, code markup, and the like.
        Tables are only used to mark up tabular data. Layout is done entirely with CSS. A standards-compliant browser
        such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Firefox</a> is highly
        encouraged.</p>
    <p>Some info on understanding this site: unvisited links are blue, visited links are red. Any modern CSS-compliant
        browser will show some links with a little red arrow next to them (<a href="#" rel="external">example</a>)—these
        links point to a url outside of this site, and usually open in a new browser window. There are non-external
        links that open in new windows, and there might be unmarked external links, but the arrows should help.</p>

    <h1 id="typography">Typography</h1>
    <p>Typography on the web is difficult—there’s no guarantee your readers will have even one of the fonts you
        want to use, and if they’re using <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window - The lynx web browser">lynx</a> you might as well not even bother. As such, I
        have kept wadny.com’s typography fairly simple.</p>
    <p>The body text should be a simple sans-serif font (probably Verdana on Windows, and Lucida Grande on Macintosh OS
        X). The headings are hopefully Palatino Linotype, which I think is absolutely gorgeous; if you’re unlucky enough
        not to have it, the fallback is Times New Roman (*shudder*) or plain Times (which I believe is a font on some
        Unixes). The images in the sidebar may be hand-rendered text; I didn’t make them, so I don’t know.</p>
    <p>I have also tried to ensure that all punctuation is correct, by using alternate Unicode characters for quotes,
        dashes, ellipses, and other special characters. The effect is subtle, but I believe it is a worthwhile
        enhancement.</p>

    <h1 id="production">Production</h1>
    <p>Virtually everything on this site is hand-made by me (the icons and sidebar link images being notable
        exceptions). I currently use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window">Visual Studio Code</a> for editing text and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/"
            rel="external" title="Opens in a new window"><abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr></a>
        for editing images. Many of the icons in the header are from <a href="https://www.kottke.org/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window">Jason Kottke’s weblog</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The site content is managed in <a href="https://dev.azure.com/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window">Azure DevOps</a>. Files are stored in a git repository, processed through
        Jekyll using an automated build pipeline, and deployed to <a
            href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window">Azure App Service</a> using an automated release pipeline. I’ll have to write
        a blog post explaining this system in more detail. It’s pretty technical to understand and set up the
        automation, but the end result is I can make changes on my desktop (or easily set up an environment on any
        computer with a couple standard tools), and deploy those changes with literally two or three clicks.</p>
