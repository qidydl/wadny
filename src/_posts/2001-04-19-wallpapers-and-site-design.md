title: Wallpapers and site design
---
Wow, two posts in a month… lots going on :-)

First off, there’s a bunch of new wallpapers up in the desktop area, see if you can figure out what they are. Maybe I should add dates and sorting to browse.php… nah.

Second, I actually made a new webdesign, it’s at [wadny.com/design/memheap/]({% link design/summary.md %}#memheap), ~~instead of the designs section, because I’m hoping to actually do something with it. Maybe I will…~~
