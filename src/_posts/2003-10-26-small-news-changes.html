title: Small news changes
---
<p>So, I’m planning on doing some more work on my news section… I’m going to switch the <abbr
        title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed to use full posts instead of excerpts, add titles and
    categories to news posts, add TrackBack support, and maybe add the code to let me delete news posts. I’ll probably
    also be cleaning up some random stuff on the site, but not anything major. I <em>might</em> do a redesign sometime,
    because this one is starting to look a little goofy to me, but probably not anytime soon.</p>

    <br>I just went through all the old news posts and did some revisions, mainly correcting punctuation to use the
    proper characters (— for an em-dash and that sort of thing). Yes, it was an incredibly anal thing to do, but I
    think it makes the site look a little nicer. I also cleaned up a couple of acronyms and other boring stuff. I’ve
    got a big list of things to work on, so the site should be improving over the next week or two.</ins></p>
