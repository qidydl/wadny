title: Eschew obfuscation
---
[Doug Bowman](http://www.stopdesign.com/ "Stopdesign"){:rel='external'} recently wrote an excellent [article advocating CSS-based design](https://stopdesign.com/archive/2004/07/27/throwing-tables.html "Stopdesign: Throwing Tables Out the Window"){:rel='external'}, where he rebuilds microsoft.com without using tables for layout (which would save Microsoft nearly 329 terabytes of bandwidth a year). Shortly thereafter, [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/){:rel='external'} offered [his comments on the article](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0704e.shtml "Jeffrey Zeldman: Only defenestrate"){:rel='external'}, where he praises it for being short and full of useful content. Unfortunately, he misses an opportunity to simplify the message even further. Stealing an idea from Fark (which stole it from a movie), I have managed to reduce Dougâ€™s article to a mere *seven words*. Here they are:

> Old and busted: tables. New hotness: CSS.
