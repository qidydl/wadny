title: Much more metadata
---
<p>So, I added a bunch more metadata and linkage to the site today. The Recommended links section in the sidebar is now
    filled out with the blogs I read, including <abbr title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</abbr> data. I added a meta tag
    for my location and a GeoURL link in the sidebar so you (or I) can see who lives near me. I added a <abbr
        title="Friend Of A Friend">FOAF</abbr> file so you can learn a little more about me. Lastly, I revamped the
    regular About page with a bunch more information and structure.</p>

    I’ve seen on calibrating your monitor for proper gamma and color.</p>
