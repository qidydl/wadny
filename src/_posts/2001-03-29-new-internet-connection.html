title: New internet connection
---
<p>About a month ago, Rhythms decided they didn’t feel like providing <abbr title="Digital Subscriber Line">DSL</abbr>
    service in this area, and with the convenient departure of Covad and Northpoint as well, I had no internet access.
    How convenient.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m stuck using a crappy cable connection from the local cable company, and it’s definitely worse than the
    DSL I had before. Hopefully, I’ll be able to get on something better in the near future.</p>
<p>P.S.: my old email account from PhoenixDSL (which no longer actually exists) still works. Go figure. If you want to
    email me, use <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript"
        onclick="location.href=email(); return false">qid[at]wadny.com</a> instead.</p>
