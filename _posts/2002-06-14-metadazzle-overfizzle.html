title: Metadazzle overfizzle

<p>HA!  My weblog has more metadata stuff than your weblog!</p>
<p>Seriously, I’ve got 5 meta tags, 6 link tags, a script tag, and the omnipresent title tag cluttering up my &lt;head&gt;.  A couple of the metas might be useless (I found them in the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/styleguide/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - New York Public Library Style Guide">NYPL Style Guide</a>) but I’ll leave them unless someone tells me otherwise.  Complying to undefined standards, ooooo fun!</p>
<p>lanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanpartylanparty!  I have NO idea what tomorrow is gonna be like… that’s how it typically works with us (the local lan party kids)—next to zero preparation, just show up and hope people bring hubs.</p>
<p>Ugh, my ongoing cold thing has now mutated once again.  It started out as a stuffy nose, then added a sore throat, then seemed to clear up, and now it’s changed into a cough and runny nose.  Isn’t biology fun?  *cough*</p>
<p>Attention <a href="http://www.kottke.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - A very well-known blogger who knows lots of other well-known bloggers">Jason Kottke</a>:</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 3px; padding: 3px">Sure, you can debate the merits of Mozilla, but it is undeniably better than Netscape 4, primarily because it doesn’t royally suck at rendering modern, standards-compliant websites (such as mine, megnut, pseudofamous, and countless others).  Back in the good ‘ol days of “Every browser make up a new version of HTML and JavaScript to support, and ignore what anyone else uses”, Netscape 4 worked  decently well.  However, now we’re moving into the age of “Every browser use the official W3C-approved versions of XHTML/HTML/JavaScript, and render them the same”, and Netscape 4 doesn’t do that.  Mozilla does.  Netscape 4 is an ancient relic now, a fossil of times long gone.
<p>As for Mozilla’s seemingly disappointing interface and features, sure, it’s not as good as it could be, but these people are just doing work in their spare time.  Apple employees are, well, employees.  If you have ideas, submit them to the Mozilla community and see what they think.  Just don’t expect too much, because these people aren’t working on Mozilla for a living.  Personally, I’m fine with Mozilla’s interface and think the browser works fine—it’s certainly better than any of the other options out there, for reasons I’m too tired to go into right now.</p>
<p><acronym title="By the way">BTW</acronym>, I’m sorry if this seems harsh or angry or anything.  My thoughts aren’t very coherent after being up for almost 18 hours and all this text is just kinda running together.  Bleh.</p>

<p>One last thing; it’s pretty customary for blogs to link to interesting articles or other blogs.  Since I get all my articles off <a href="http://slashdot.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - News for nerds, stuff that matters">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Technology and culture, from the trenches">Kuro5hin</a> anyways, you can just page through those sites.  Here’s a random blog <a href="http://www.pseudofamous.com/archives/00000444.htm" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Oooh, there's... comments...">link</a>.  Good night, everyone.</p>
