title: Summary

<p>I’ve made a lot of website designs over the years. Most of them have been for websites I’ve thought of making and
    then gave up on, although some have succeeded in being used. I’ve worked on designs for other people occasionally,
    and might do more in the future, but if I create any new designs they’ll most likely just wind up here. If a design
    is active, its thumbnail will take you to the current url. If I still have a design laying around, the thumbnail
    will take you to a demo version of the design, otherwise it’ll just give you a screenshot.</p>

<h2><a id="blissfull">Blissfull</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/blissfull/" title="Blissfull (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_blissfull.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Blissfull (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is an experimental design I created one day while looking at some artists’ portfolio sites. Several of them were
    based on the idea of a small piece of content isolated in the middle, and this is my version of that. Of course,
    this design would never be used because there isn’t enough room for actual content and it requires frames, which is
    a serious accessibility issue. Unlike most of my recent work, it contains no PHP—just <abbr
        title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>—and I think it
    is the only design I’ve made using inline frames.</p>

<h2><a id="brewmeister">Brewmeister</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="http://brewmeister.cs.rit.edu/~dlo6351/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Brewmeister (active)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_brewmeister.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Brewmeister (active)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This design was created basically to fill the web space in one of my accounts at school. It was created shortly after
    Blissfull, as evidenced by the use of the same colors and punctuation and similar layout. However, this design is
    even simpler—just a couple of div blocks and some basic styling. It’s an incredibly simple design, but it works.</p>

<h2><a id="design-x">Design-X</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/design-x/" title="Design-X (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_design-x.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Design-X (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>I believe this design was for a planned gaming site that was never established, and is one of my earliest experiments
    with PHP. It contains a function for creating blue-outlined boxes and sticking them in the empty space at the top. I
    believe I planned to have several of the small boxes in the empty space, containing recent or highly dynamic content.
    This is a fairly stereotypical example of my earlier work: lots of blue, darker backgrounds with white text, and
    antialised curved borders. My modern work tends to use light backgrounds with dark text and single-pixel, squared
    borders, which is more readable and easier to implement with CSS.</p>

<h2><a id="edge1">EdgeIRC version 1</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/edgeirc/" title="EdgeIRC version 1 (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_edgeirc1.png" width="368" height="276" alt="EdgeIRC version 1 (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>Unlike many of the designs on this page, this one was put into use as the website for an <abbr
        title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> network. I ran one of the first servers on the network, and volunteered
    to create the website. The design uses a very narrow centered column with an imagemap menu at the top (inspired by
    the vector drawing mode in Paint Shop Pro, as I recall). All of the pages are served out of a single PHP script, a
    system I have since moved away from. I still like the look of the menu, but imagemaps aren’t used very much
    nowadays, and the rest of the design is fairly bland.</p>

<h2><a id="edge2">EdgeIRC version 2</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/edgeirc2/" title="EdgeIRC version 2 (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_edgeirc2.png" width="368" height="276" alt="EdgeIRC version 2 (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>After a year or two of using the first EdgeIRC design, the other admins and I decided that the website should be
    redesigned. This is the first attempt, and I liked the way it looked, but it was a little too much. On dialup
    connections, the background images take too long to load, text is difficult to read, and the design breaks
    considerably in Internet Explorer. In addition, the design carried over the single-PHP-script system from the first
    design, which I have since replaced. With a standards-compliant browser, the background images stay fixed in place
    and it appears as if the headings are shaded, but this eye-candy effect wasn’t enough to justify the problems.</p>

<h2><a id="edge3">EdgeIRC version 3</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/edgeirc3/" title="EdgeIRC version 3 (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_edgeirc3.png" width="368" height="276" alt="EdgeIRC version 3 (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>After the problems with the first EdgeIRC redesign, I decided to make something much simpler for the second attempt.
    This design uses only basic coloring and borders, which is not particularly attractive but is very usable and
    accessible. In hindsight, I almost prefer the original design, but at the time we just wanted something different.
    This design also introduced the EdgeIRC “logo” and a new color scheme that have been carried over into the <a
        href="/design/edgeirc4/">current design</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="electron">Electron Gaming</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/electron_gaming.gif" title="Electon Gaming (screenshot)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_electron_gaming.png" width="368" height="276"
            alt="Electon Gaming (screenshot)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is a design that I “reengineered” for someone. They had a basic idea (color scheme, layout, and logo), but they
    needed help with the HTML. I rewrote everything, including the organization of the tables, and smoothed it out. Of
    course, if I had done this today, I would have used standards-based XHTML and CSS instead of tables, and I would
    have built it on top of PHP so that the pages could be dynamically generated. At the time, however, XHTML didn’t
    exist and CSS was still too new to make full use of.</p>

<h2><a id="fbiz">First Business</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/first_business.gif" title="First Business (screenshot)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_first_business.png" width="368" height="276"
            alt="First Business (screenshot)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This design is a little strange. It’s just a rewrite, like electron gaming, but I think it happened a lot earlier. I
    can’t remember exactly why I decided to rewrite the design for a business news website, but I did, and I think I
    improved on what they had, a little. If I had done this recently, the side menu wouldn’t exist (I’d probably make a
    copy of the bottom menu near the top) and it would definitely involve an SQL database for storing news posts (even
    wadny.com uses one).</p>

<h2><a id="fpsid">First-Person-Shooter Information Database</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/fpsid/" title="First Person Shooter Information Database (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_fpsid.png" width="368" height="276"
            alt="First Person Shooter Information Database (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p><abbr title="First-Person-Shooter Information Database">FPSID</abbr> is one of the immediate predecessors of this
    site, along with YDL. It was intended to be a big gaming site with information on current FPS games, but I was never
    dedicated to keeping it updated and the site had no readership, so I never found anyone to help. At the time, all of
    my content was split between YDL (for “business”) and FPSID (for everything else). This resulted in a strange
    combination of gaming site and random personal stuff, like humor articles, so I eventually scrapped it in favor of a
    single personal site (which eventually evolved into wadny.com).</p>

<h2><a id="hex">Hexographic</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/hex/" title="Hexographic (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_hexographic.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Hexographic (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This design was actually inspired by a linux screensaver with interesting animated colored hexagons that I thought I
    could turn into a neat website design. The plan was to animate the side and top images (the blue hexagons would
    light up in sequence), but that was difficult to construct and I gave up on the design before I finished any of the
    animations. The colors are rather ugly and the design isn't very interesting any more, but the animation effect
    could be interesting if I had finished it.</p>

<h2><a id="memheap">the memory heap</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/memheap/" title="the memory heap (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_memheap.png" width="368" height="276" alt="the memory heap (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This was created sometime around the 2001 May 1st Reboot, as part of a plan to integrate the whole site together into
    a domain. I was planning on something along the lines of
    <a href="http://www.everything2.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Everything2</a>, where you could
    add stuff into a massive database—images, text, links, sounds, anything. Common sense (this would require lots of
    disk space, which costs lots of money) and laziness (the menu images were a pain to make) won, however, and the
    design was archived. It does have a few elements of this site, though—the icon (enlarged) and the random quote. If
    I had the resources to make a website that could possibly contain multiple gigs of data, I might resurrect this
    site, but I don’t.</p>

<h2><a id="planet">Planetgaming</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/planetgaming/" title="Planetgaming (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_planetgaming.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Planetgaming (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is one of my older designs, from a period where I seemed to like using brightness gradients. I think I was
    trying to do lens flares, but it just looks a little strange now. This site was supposed to replace FPSID, but the
    vision was (like <a href="#memheap">the memory heap</a>) beyond my capabilities. I think I actually pitched the idea
    of a site like this to the GameSpy network, who already had their in-house team working on something. I was slightly
    peeved at the time, but now I don’t blame them for rejecting my design (it’s not that good). I never quite liked how
    the top and side were different sizes, and the site is far too dark.</p>

<h2><a id="qidnu">qid.nu</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/qid.nu/" title="qid.nu (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_qidnu.png" width="368" height="276" alt="qid.nu (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This design was one of the first two I created when I wanted to do a big reorganization of my site, but before I
    decided to unify everything in one design. They still required a lot of work to move some sections from one design
    to another—this is before I discovered PHP and how to separate content from design. Both of these designs were
    eventually superseded by a series of simple pages using the current yellow color, and I have no plans to bother with
    the qid.nu domain anymore.</p>

<h2><a id="qidnumenu">qid.nu-menu</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/qid.nu-menu/" title="qid.nu-menu (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_qidnu-menu.png" width="368" height="276" alt="qid.nu-menu (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is a different design, intended to be used for the same purpose as the design above. I replaced it with the one
    above due to the difficulty of changing the menu. Both of these designs aren’t too interesting, and I chose some bad
    colors for links—the red is really difficult to read. I suppose it’s a good thing I never tried to use them. Also,
    the “individual” rant on these designs is from my “angsty teenager” days—I’ve since moved on to “apathetic college
    student.”</p>

<h2><a id="thesite">Thesite</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/thesite/index.php" title="Thesite (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_thesite.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Thesite (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is kind of the predecessor to memheap. It was intended to be a very easily maintained design—the menu was
    dynamically generated based on a data file in each directory. Another trick was a link at the bottom of every page
    to view the source for that page. The real problem was getting the menu to nest and tree the way it did—it took some
    tricky recursion to get it to work just right. The concept was interesting, although it could have been executed
    better, and the design definitely needed work. This is more of a PHP demo than an interesting website design. Also,
    I’ve recently noticed that the menu no longer works—I’m not sure why, and I decided not to fix it because I have no
    intention of actually using this design.</p>

<h2><a id="unroyal">Unroyal</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/unroyal/" title="Unroyal (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_unroyal.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Unroyal (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This was a redesign for an Unreal level review site, but I wound up pretty much starting over. I was starting to
    learn about how to make a website modular and easy to maintain, so I used some of those ideas in this site. All
    of the level reviews were in separate HTML files that could get included in any page, which was good, but I
    believed an SQL database would be better. Unfortunately, I hadn’t learned how to access one yet, only what it was.
    :-D Of course, this site was hosted on the GameSpy network, which has no idea how to properly set up a webserver
    (they use NT and, no doubt, IIS), so I probably would have had to learn ASP or something even more revolting. The
    site died anyways, due to lack of effort from level reviewers, so I didn’t get a chance to do anything with SQL
    until much later.</p>

<h2><a id="useless">Useless</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/useless/" title="Useless (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_useless.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Useless (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This was just a fun experiment in using Javascript and <abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr>.
    The site that inspired it now has completely different content—it used to be a collection of very advanced
    Javascript/DHTML experiments. The random color changing squares should work in any Javascript-enabled
    browser, but “orange” has varying problems in anything besides NS4. Don’t worry, you’re not missing much.</p>

<h2><a id="wadny-band">Wadny</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/wadny/" title="Wadny (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_wadny.png" width="368" height="276" alt="Wadny (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This was the original site for the band Wadny, of which my father was one of the founding members. All of the content
    for this site is now in the Band section, so, unlike most of the other sites here, this one is still around, sort
    of. I still like some of the fonts and basic layout, but the orange color is definitely wrong—it’s supposed to look
    like copper. This site is one of the few on here that was actually up and running, although I never got everything
    up at once—it was always hosted on ISP accounts with limited space, so the sample music files were somewhere else.</p>

<h2><a id="ydlnew">YDL-new</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/ydl-new/" title="YDL-new (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_ydl-new.png" width="368" height="276" alt="YDL-new (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This is the replacement design for YDL, although even it is pretty old. The concept of YDL had gotten far less
    ambitious—now it was mostly there for me to show off stuff that would be acceptable on a résumé, like website
    designs and various things I’ve coded. This design was less ugly than the old one, although the layers and
    Javascript got pretty complex (and it no longer works). There were a couple problems I never quite solved, although
    they weren’t very major. All the content on this site that’s still relevant is in the current design, so don’t
    worry about all the non-functional links.</p>

<h2><a id="ydlold">YDL-old</a></h2>
<div class="designthumb">
    <a href="/design/summary/ydl-old/" title="YDL-old (demo)">
        <img src="/design/summary/thumbnails/th_ydl-old.png" width="368" height="276" alt="YDL-old (demo)" />
    </a>
</div>
<p>This was the first design I created for YDL, which was my “business” site. I planned to do webdesigning (and
    hopefully earn some money) and distribute mIRC scripts, but the webdesign never really took off and I’ve never been
    able to find anyone good at making mIRC scripts who won’t disappear. YDL was redesigned after a while, and the
    second design was much better—and more complex—than this one. I can pretty much guarantee that none of the info on
    this site is accurate any more.</p>
