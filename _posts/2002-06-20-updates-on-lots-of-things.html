title: Updates on lots of things

<p>Gah, that sucked. For some reason, my website decided to randomly start spewing several pages of warnings and PHP
    crap on the screen. I fixed it, but I have no idea why it broke in the first place. Looking at what went wrong, it
    <em>should</em> have broken a while ago, but it didn’t… very strange. Anyways, I kind of slacked on the blogging for
    a while, so here’s what’s new:</p>
<p>First of all, the physics exam went ok, as expected. It seemed to take a really long time and it was a little harder
    than the practice exam we got, but it wasn’t that hard. I leeched a ride home from the same friend who helped me out
    after the english exam. Bah, I still need a license/car…</p>
<p>I’ve been slowly working my way through the taped Le Mans coverage, I won’t be surprised if Audi pulls a 1-2-3. Those
    LMP675 MG’s are doing surprisingly well though, they’ve been competing with the Audis as well as anyone else. It’ll
    be interesting to see how their fuel economy helps them over the long run.</p>
<p>Ok, <a href="http://www.npr.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - National Public Radio">NPR</a> is <a

        title="Opens in a new window - WIRED: Big Stink Over a Simple Link">tradition</a> of moronic companies like <a
        href="http://www.kpmg.com/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - KPMG - a dumb company">KPMG</a>, they
    are trying to require permission from people to link to them. I don’t know why people do this, all it does is
    backfire on them and within a couple days numerous blogs and websites have posted countless links to them and
    laughed at how incredibly stupid they are.</p>
<p>Also, I made some changes to the comments system. All HTML tags are now stripped from comments except for the
    following: &lt;a&gt;, &lt;abbr>, &lt;acronym>, &lt;big>, &lt;blockquote>, &lt;br>, &lt;cite>, &lt;code>, &lt;em>,
    &lt;li>, &lt;ol>, &lt;p>, &lt;small>, &lt;strong>, &lt;sub>, &lt;sup>, &lt;u>, and &lt;ul>. Obviously, closing tags
    are allowed also.</p>
<p>One last thing: in the searchbar, there’s now a little XML icon that links to the RDF feed for this page. Feel free
    to throw it up on aggregators or whatever, but please tell me if you do.</p>
