title: Lazy, lazy, lazy…

<p>Lazy, lazy, lazy… I haven’t updated in quite a while, I haven’t managed to do much with the news system, and the
    possible redesign <ins datetime="2004-01-12T19:25:00-05:00">(this refers to the design you’re currently looking at,
        so obviously I finished it)</ins> hasn’t gotten off the ground yet. Maybe this weekend I’ll be able to make some
    progress, if I get lucky. In case anyone’s interested (and so I’ll remember), this is the current list of things
    I’ll be changing: a redesign (most likely); a “quicklinks” system (it seems to be a popular thing these days); an
    improved news system to let you see all posts made during a specific year, month, or day; a calendar showing posts
    in the current month; titles and maybe categories for news posts; and proper stylesheets for screen readers and
    printing. I’m also wondering what sort of neat metadata-foolery I should try doing—for example, <a
        href="http://diveintomark.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Mark Pilgrim’s weblog</a> has a
    link with each comment to view other comments posted by that person. Maybe I’ll put together a mockup of the
    redesigned news page soon and see if that helps sort things out.</p>
<p>There’s probably a ton of stuff I should have posted on in the last month or two—school and the holidays and
    whatnot—but I’ll probably never get around to it now. It’s late, and I need sleep… more tomorrow.</p>
