title: www. is deprecated
---
I just made my site [no-www](http://no-www.org){:rel='external'} class B compliant. In other words, requests for `www.wadny.com/(anything)` are silently redirected to `wadny.com/(anything)`. Old links are not broken, and users shouldn’t notice a difference, but it makes me feel better. I got the idea from [Kevin](http://rapidhate.org){:rel='external'}, who is also class B compliant but hasn’t admitted it.

In other news, I’ve been working on getting a few other designs up in the Design section. They might appear in a few days, and I’ll make another post with details if they do. I may also have another big essay-style post (à la My 2¢ on Postel’s Law) in the coming days. We’ll see.

<ins datetime="2004-01-28T22:27:00-05:00">Update on January 28: Some people have gotten the mistaken impression that the W3C has officially deprecated the use of “www.” in URLs or something similar. That’s just silly. If you read [the no-www website](http://no-www.org/){:rel='external'}, you can see that it’s just a logical idea that someone had and I happen to agree with it. That’s it.</ins>
