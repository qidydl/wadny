title: New computer hardware
---
<p>I made a few updates to the YDL pages today, there’s new stuff on the programming pages and a new IDTScript version.</p>
<p>On the computer front, my <abbr title="Sound Blaster">SB</abbr>Live! Platinum came in a few days ago and it’s working
    great. No lockups in games, fullscreen winamp vis, etc.</p>
<p>Also, I bought an optical Logitech MouseMan Wheel, and it’s working pretty well. I’m not sure what to do with the
    thumb button though…</p>
