title: "Wadny II: The Return of Wadny"
---
<p>Holy crap, I’m finally back! After god knows how long of being down, wadny.com is back on the air with new
    hosting—and, you may have noticed, a bunch of other changes.</p>

<p>First off, the site now uses valid <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> 1.0 and <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 2 for all of its pages, with cute little &lt;div&gt; tags instead of
    those clunky old tables.</p>
<p>Second, I played around with the stylesheets a bit and added colored form boxes, some slight link changes, and these
    awesome little “external link” icons that animate when you mouseover the link. To see an example of those, click on
    the “help!” link in the upper right of the page—another new feature. This page gives some quick info to help you
    navigate the site, although it does open in a javascript popup.</p>
<p>The other major feature being added—it’s not done yet—is a brand-new comments system for the news. I’m hoping to make
    the news page a little more like the ubiquitous blog (although how many blogs contain the word “ubiquitous?”), so I
    thought feedback would be a good idea. When it’s finished, you’ll be able to comment on any news story, even the old
    ones.</p>
<p>One last note—I’m still getting everything working, so some sections aren’t uploaded yet (currently design, forum,
    gaming, humor, mirc, and webcam are empty) and some options—like the &lt;section name&gt;.wadny.com access
    method—aren’t working yet. Hopefully by next weekend I’ll have some time to get these running. I’m finally back!</p>
