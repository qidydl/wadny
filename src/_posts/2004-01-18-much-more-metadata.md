title: Much more metadata
---
So, I added a bunch more metadata and linkage to the site today. The Recommended links section in the sidebar is now filled out with the blogs I read, including XFN data. I added a meta tag for my location and a GeoURL link in the sidebar so you (or I) can see who lives near me. I added a FOAF file so you can learn a little more about me. Lastly, I revamped the regular About page with a bunch more information and structure.

You may be interested in this link: [Monitor calibration and gamma](http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1A.html){:rel='external'}. It’s just about the most comprehensive article I’ve seen on calibrating your monitor for proper gamma and color.
