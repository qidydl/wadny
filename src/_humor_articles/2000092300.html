<p>The Arkansas School Board, following Oakland's lead of labeling African American slang as the language "Ebonics," has decided to pursue some of the seemingly endless taxpayer
dollar pipeline through Washington designating Southern slang, "Hickbonics", as a language to be taught in all Southern schools. A speaker of this language would be a Hickophone.
