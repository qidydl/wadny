title: Mobilization
---
For probably the first time in its history (mostly because its active history predates the mobile web), wadny.com now
has a usable mobile design. It’s not very exciting—the normal menu just gets overlaid on top of the content, and there’s
a button to toggle it—but it works. It also has the convenient side effect of solving some layout issues that happened
in a narrow window at high zoom levels, because it just automatically transitions to the mobile layout once the space
becomes sufficiently cramped.

There’s still some work to do (as noted at the top of the index page), but the site should hopefully now be usable for
everyone, regardless of how you browse the web.
