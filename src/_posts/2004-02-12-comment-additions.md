title: Comment additions
---
I made a couple slight additions to the comments system. First, I changed the e-mail field to a URL field, where you can basically stick whatever kind of URL you want. You can still put in just a plain e-mail address, and `mailto:` will get added to the front of it automatically. Also, I added permalinks to the comments, so you can post a link to any specific comment. This should come in handy if my site ever has any large conversations going on. Iâ€™ve also updated the News > About page with this information.
