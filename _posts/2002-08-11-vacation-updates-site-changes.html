title: Vacation updates, site changes
---
<p>Gee, almost a month… I’m falling back into my regular routine. Well… I’ve done a few things since the last update. I
    went to an <abbr title="Sports Car Club of America">SCCA</abbr> autocross with my dad one weekend, found out who my
    roommate at <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr> will be (he lives in Colorado, quite a
    ways further away than I am), bought a laptop (our first, a $900 Compaq that isn’t real fast but should be plenty
    for taking notes at college), and took a week-long vacation to Quebec. Whee! There’s probably more I’m forgetting,
    heh.</p>
<p>The only thing in that list worth explaining more is the Quebec vacation. First we headed out to
    Trois-Rivi&egrave;res (Three Rivers) for the <a href="http://www.gptr.qc.ca/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - Grand Prix de Trois-Rivieres">“Grand Prix”</a>, which was actually <abbr
        title="American Le Mans Series">ALMS</abbr>, Trans-Am, Speed World Challenge, Toyota Atlantic, and Canadian
    Formula Ford races all rolled into one big three-day weekend. We had a good time and saw some nice racing (and got
    sunburned) and then headed off to a campground (we took our motorhome for this vacation) just outside of Montreal
    and spent three days wandering around the city. We saw the botanical gardens and an IMAX movie at the science center
    and wandered around a lot and got the obligatory Hard Rock Cafe shirts and had an excellent dinner at a little cafe
    called Le Grille.</p>
<p>Another newsworthy item: I just ordered an Alienware computer to replace my aging desktop system. It’s a customized
    Aurora DDR system and should be a massive improvement over this old T-bird 900mhz box. Of course, since we waited
    until AFTER the vacation to order it, I get to spend my last week before leaving for college scrambling to install
    all the stuff I need—<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" rel="external"

<p>Lastly, the site has once again changed a bit: you’ve probably noticed this box on the right side of the page labeled
    “The Sidebar”. This is kind of an experiment for a better way to arrage some of the content on the site and clean up
    the menu block. I may wind up putting all of the menu stuff into this side box at some point in the future, but for
    now I’m just playing around a bit.</p>
