title: Computer updates

More news:  my laptop is apparently fixed, and Airborne Express already tried to deliver it once while I was asleep.  Alienware has agreed to send me a replacement video card—they’re giving me a Radeon 9600 Pro to replace my GeForce4 Ti4600, which is rather nice of them.  Niagara Mohawk came by and replaced our electric meter with a new electronic one, which is good, but they didn’t tell us they were doing this and just randomly shut off the power to our house, which is incredibly stupid.  Thanks for another power outage, idiots.  Fortunately all our computers have battery backups, so we didn’t lose anything.
<p>In other words, nothing’s changed, but it’s closer.</p>
