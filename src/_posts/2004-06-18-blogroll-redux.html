title: Blogroll redux
---
<p>Now that I’m doing the 8-to-5 life, I’ve taken to spending the first hour or so at work catching up on weblogs; this
    is somewhat justified, as a lot of the blogs I read will post technical articles, which applies directly to my job
    as a webdesigner (yes, I know I haven’t posted about the job yet; I’ll get around to it). As a result, I’ve picked
    up a few new sites and tired of a few old ones, so my blogroll has been updated. The new sites are <a
        href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Andy Clarke">And all
        that malarkey</a>, <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/" rel="external"
        title="Opens in a new window - D. Keith Robinson">Asterisk</a>, <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Cameron Moll">Authentic Boredom</a>, <a
        href="http://boxofchocolates.ca/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Derek Featherstone">Box of
        chocolates</a>, <a href="http://decaffeinated.org/" rel="external"

        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Mike Davidson</a>, <a href="http://phark.typepad.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Mike Rundle</a>, <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Steve Smith">OrderedList</a>, <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Shaun Inman</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Raymond Chen">The Old New Thing</a>, <a href="http://waxy.org/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Andy Baio">Waxy.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org/"
        rel="external" title="Opens in a new window - Todd Dominey">What Do I Know</a>. I also dropped a few sites that
    weren’t updating very often to make room for this big influx. I may have to cut out a couple of sites to keep the
    list manageable, but we’ll see how this works.</p>
