  what is this?</p>
<p class="newstext">this is an experimental website design.  it doesn't do anything, it doesn't tell you anything important, and it probably breaks any
   browser older than NS6/IE6.  however, if you happen to have a CSS2-compliant browser like one of those two, this site might look interesting to you.  then
   again, you could be a tasteless fool like R1CH and hate it.  to each his own.</p>

  ok, now what?</p>
<p class="newstext">well, you could go <a href="http://www.edgeirc.net" target="_new">here</a>, <a href="http://www.endeffect.com" target="_new">here</a>,
   <a href="http://www.deskmod.com" target="_new">here</a>, or to any one of several other places.  or you could click back and forth between the "news" and
   "about" pages, if you're reeeaaally bored.</p>
