title: Vacation, Part I
---
Tomorrow morning, my parents and I leave for [Mosport International Raceway](http://www.mosport.com/){:rel='external'} for a weekend of racing, featuring the American Le Mans Series and Speed World Challenge. This means I won’t have access to anything even vaguely resembling the Internet, so there won’t be any posts for a few days. Of course, next week is [QuakeCon](http://www.quakecon.org/){:rel='external'}, so I’m doing a lot of travelling in the near future; however, QuakeCon should have Internet access, so I’ll be able to blog from there.
