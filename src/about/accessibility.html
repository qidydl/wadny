title: Accessibility
---
<p>Wadny.com includes many accessibility features, most of which I learned from Mark Pilgrim on <a
        href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">DiveIntoAccessibility</a>.
    If you have any questions or comments, you can send me an e-mail—a link is in the sidebar.</p>

<h2>Access keys</h2>
<p>Many browsers support jumping to links or form elements by using key combinations defined on a website. On Windows or
    Unix/BSD-based systems, the normal key combination is <code>ALT + accesskey</code>; on Macs, the usual combination
    is <code>Control + accesskey</code>. Wadny.com includes the following access keys:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access key “0”: This page</li>
    <li>Access key “1”: Home page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Standards compliance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All pages on wadny.com should validate as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5. The <abbr
            title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> of wadny.com is also validated. Validator links are provided in
        the sidebar to check this—if you find non-validating pages, please tell me.</li>
    <li>Wadny.com is <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/" rel="external"
            title="Opens in a new window - Bobby validator for accessibility">Bobby</a> approved for U.S. Section 508
        and should also be approved for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 1.0, except that the Bobby
        validator incorrectly believes that the <code>onclick</code> event handler is mouse-only—in every browser
        I have tested it with, it works using either a keyboard or mouse. Thus, my site is <abbr
            title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>-compliant, although Bobby does not validate it.
    </li>
    <li>I have attempted to use structured semantic markup and CSS-based aesthetics whenever possible. This means all
        headings should be marked up with <code>&lt;h#&gt;</code> tags, tabular data (and ONLY tabular data) is marked
        up with summarized, captioned tables, and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Naviation aids</h2>
<p>All pages have <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags pointing to the wadny.com home page and the Atom version of my news
    page. These links should already be usable in text-only browsers and screen readers, and users of the latest version
    of Mozilla (and possibly Netscape) can use these links by enabling the Site Navigation Bar (View, Show/Hide, Site
    Navigation Bar, Show Only As Needed or Show Always). There is also a seach box which allows you to search all of
    wadny.com using Google or perfom general searches with dozens of different search engines.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Many links include title attributes to provide further information about the link or to indicate if the link opens in
    a new window. This helps links make sense out of context. Also, there are no <code>javascript:</code> pseudo-links,
    even though some links will open in new windows in browsers that support them. In addition, links that open in new
    windows are indicated by a small red arrow to the left of the link and the phrase “Opens in a new
    window” in the link title.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Wadny.com uses a minimum of images to cut down on download time and improve accessibility. All images used on this
    site have descriptive alt attributes so users of text-only browsers are not prevented from using them. For users
    that are displaying images, there is usually also a title for the image to display as a tooltip.</p>

<h2>Visual/print design</h2>
<p>This site uses CSS for visual layout, both on a monitor and when printed. When a page on this site is printed out, it
    should include the URLs for links and the expanded version of an acronym. When the page is read in a screen reader,
    it should work properly due to the very simplified markup; however, this is untested. If you are aware of any issues
    with my site when it is handled by a screen reader, please let me know via the e-mail link in the sidebar.</p>

<h2>Wrapup</h2>
<p>This site and its accessibility features are a work in progress. If you would like to suggest changes to make to the
    site or this page, or have comments of any kind, feel free to contact me; an e-mail link is in the sidebar.</p>
