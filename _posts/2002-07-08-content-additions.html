Added some more site stuff today.  There’s a new humor article if you want some light reading, and I added <acronym title="First Person Shooter Information Database">FPSID</acronym> (the major predecessor to this site) to the design section.  I’ve also been cleaning up things here and there, moving stuff around, pruning code… general maintenance stuff.  Just a reminder, you’re welcome to try and break my code, just let me know if you find anything, either with an <a href="mailto:qid[at]wadny.com" title="Replace the [at] with an @ if you don't have javascript" onclick="location.href=email(); return false">email</a> or a comment.
