<h2>My design portfolio</h2>
<p>Over the years, I have created a number of website designs—some have been used, many have not. This section is an
    archive of all of the designs I still have a copy of, or
    at least a screenshot of. I have created separate pages for some of my newer (and, I think, better) designs. All of
    the other designs are listed together, with short summaries,
    on the <a href="design/summary/">Summary</a> page. Many of those designs are old, and make use of technologies that
    have since become outdated, and thus should not
    be considered examples of good contemporary websites. The separate portfolio pages, however, should be reasonably
    current.</p>
<h2>Individual portfolio sites</h2>
<p>Currently, there are three sites with individual portfolios: EdgeIRC 4, RIT Honors, and Wadny.com. <a
        href="/design/edgeirc4/">EdgeIRC 4</a> is the fourth version
    of edgeirc.net, and as of this writing is the current design used on that website. <a href="/design/rithonors/">RIT
        Honors</a> is the design for the student-run
    website on the <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr> Honors Program server. <a
        href="/design/wadny.com/">Wadny.com</a> is the website
    you’re looking at.</p>
