title: Menu improvements
---
<p>Ok, a couple more changes to the site. The menu now sends you to www.wadny.com/sectionname/ instead of
    www.wadny.com/index.php?sec=dumbnumber, which should be much easier to understand and cache better in browsers.
    Also, I did a bunch of reworking on the browse script so it actually works this way instead of breaking and being
    ugly and stuff. I’m also working on getting the subdomains set up again, so you’ll actually have all 4 access
    methods (see <a href="/news/during/2001/7/22/">July 22nd 2001</a>) working again.</p>
