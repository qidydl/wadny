title: Elastic Revisions
---
You may notice that wadny.com is slightly wider. It seems that [everyone’s](http://binarybonsai.com/ "Binary Bonsai"){:rel='external'} [websites](http://www.maniacalrage.net/ "Maniacal Rage"){:rel='external'} [are](http://www.kottke.org/ "kottke.org"){:rel='external'} [wider](http://www.1976design.com/blog/ "1976design.com blog"){:rel='external'} now, and the content column has always felt a bit constricting, so I made it bigger. While I was at it, I switched so the columns are now specified relative to the font size, so if you make your fonts bigger the line length will stay the same—this is referred to as “elastic design,” hence the title. I was considering a larger-scale redesign, and may still do one later, but this was enough of an improvement for me to hold off on any major changes. I’ll probably wait until after QuakeCon (which is also after my co-op should end), at which point I plan on starting a new windows install on my desktop, and then I’ll go ahead and do a more significant website redesign. I’ve considered switching to a packaged weblog system, but I probably won’t. We’ll see what happens.

What brought this on? Well, [Garrett Murray](http://www.maniacalrage.net/ "Maniacal Rage: Senseless acts of writing"){:rel='external'} is vying for [Justin Goodlett’s title](http://9rules.com/whitespace/whitespace/first_ever_whitespace_awards.php "Whitespace: First Ever Whitespace Awards"){:rel='external'} by redesigning *again*. Relatively minor changes, but his site still looks excellent. I notice he now uses relative dates on the front page and actual dates everywhere else, the same as I do, although he did it intentionally, whereas I did it because I was too lazy to go mucking around in the archives script again, but as long as someone else thought it was a good idea, I’ll stick with it. I’ll definitely have to steal that quicksearch thing he has and work it into The Multisearch Box™.
