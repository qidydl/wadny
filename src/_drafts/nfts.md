I've had the misfortune of running into some [crypto bros](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crypto%20bro){:rel='external'} on various social media, and I can't decide whether the hype around NFTs is more hilarious or more insane, but at this point it's definitely some of each. In order to understand why, let's review some of the building blocks of cryptography.

### Hashes

A [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function){:rel='external'} is a key concept to understand. Let's consider a metaphor: we all know that people can more or less be identified by their fingerprints. In general, everyone has them, and they are unique, but obviously you can't reconstruct someone's entire appearance from their fingerprints. A cryptographic hash is a similar idea: you can generate a hash that uniquely identifies some digital content (any data, including but not limited to text, images, videos, applications, etc.), but you can't reconstruct the content from the hash. Any change to the content, no matter how trivial, will result in an entirely different hash, like how even identical twins don't have the same fingerprints.

Unlike fingerprints, however, there are *lots* of different cryptographic hash algorithms out there, with varying characteristics. Those differences are not relevant for this explanation, but the key is that you have to know which algorithm was used in order to check whether a given piece of content has the hash you're looking for.

### Blockchains

[Blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain){:rel='external'} are a bit complicated, but fortunately the details are not actually too relevant to this article either. Basically, a blockchain functions as an [accounting ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger){:rel='external'} of transactions. There's a lot of new and different aspects of blockchains compared to traditional practices, but the key is that they can be used to identify when a transaction has occurred, the accounts participating in the transaction, and what was transferred.

### What NFTs Changed

Most people think of blockchains in terms of [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency){:rel='external'}, like [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin){:rel='external'}. Economically speaking, cryptocurrencies, like traditional currencies (e.g. the US Dollar) are [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility){:rel='external'}, which means that any one of them, any given dollar or bitcoin, is worth exactly as much as any other (coin collectors notwithstanding). The idea of an NFT is to exchange something other than just cryptocurrency--but what, exactly?

The idea is to transfer digital content (images are especially popular at the moment), but there is a problem: storing the content in the blockchain itself is 

What an NFT actually *is*, effectively, is a **receipt**. It is a record that establishes that a purchase was made, and the blockchain records who is in possession of that record, and what they exchanged in order to get it.
