title: The pain of encryption
---
<p>Well, I just had a rather annoying adventure with attempting to use PGP encryption stuff on my e-mail. I found a
    plugin/module thing for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">Mozilla</a>
    that would supposedly use <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">GnuPG</a> to
    encrypt or sign my emails and also decrypt or verify incoming emails. Key word: “supposedly”. As it turns out,
    there’s virtually no way to find public PGP keys on the web, so I never managed to verify anything, and the whole
    thing seemed pretty shoddy, so I removed it. I might try again sometime, but not anytime soon. That’s the problem
    with open-source stuff… it usually sounds great and has a lot of neat ideas, but all too often it turns out to be in
    perpetual beta and doesn’t do a damned thing. Also, it appears the Jabber server I use is down; Jabber is
    (surprise!) an open-source instant messaging system that fakes interoperability with AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo
    instant messaging systems that kicks ass when it works but breaks far more often than the proprietary systems. It’s
    really annoying how the more open-source a program is, the less reliably it works.</p>
<p>Oh well, I have one of my two exams tomorrow… this first one is English 12, oh boy. The next one—Regents Physics—is
    on Tuesday (the 18th). After these two exams, I’m finally done with high school! W00T!</p>
