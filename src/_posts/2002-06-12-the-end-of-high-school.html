title: The end of high school
---
<p>Ok, I finally got around to adding “pages” to the news script. Now the front page only shows the 10 newest news
    posts, and you can page back and forth using the convenient links along the bottom. It’s sort of a hack, but it’s a
    lot easier than any kind of real archiving system. That’s the last technical obstacle to me actually blogging on
    this page, instead of just using it as “the latest updates to wadny.com”. All that’s left is for me to care enough
    to do anything, heh.</p>
<p>Well, hey, let’s throw down some crap to get started… last “day” of school was, today, woohoo! Unfortunately, I got
    this really crappy sore throat/cold thing yesterday, and I didn’t get to go. I didn’t really miss anything, just a
    crappy assembly and getting my yearbook, but I really miss not being able to just talk with people and collect
    signatures and crap. I barely did anything social this year… sometimes it sucks being a computer geek. Oh well, at
    least I have college to look forward to; the people there are probably much less stereotypical and dumb than the
    people at my high school. Some morons were actually using RAP LYRICS for their senior quotes, ugh. And they were
    INTELLIGENT people too, not just your average moron. It sucks not having gone to parties and stuff like that,
    but when you realize how incredibly dumb most of these people are it kinda helps make up for it. Oh well, I’m
    hosting a LAN party on Saturday, so that should pick my spirits up. :-D Time to go get myself on weblogs.com, I’ll
    try to start making regular posts from now on.</p>
