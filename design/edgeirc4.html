<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>EdgeIRC is an Internet Relay Chat network operated by me and several of my friends. It originally went online in May
    of 2000, and had a website shortly thereafter. This is the
    fourth design I have made for the EdgeIRC website, and the third that was actually used. You can view it live at <a
        href="http://www.edgeirc.net/" rel="external" title="Opens in a new window">the EdgeIRC network website</a>.</p>
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>Like all of my current designs, EdgeIRC version 4 is entirely standards-based, using semantic <abbr
        title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> for markup and
    <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for layout and design. This results in easier development, faster
    redesigns in the future, smaller page sizes, more control
    over page design, and better accessibility for all users.</p>
<h3>Visual design</h3>
<p>Visually, version 4 represents a major evolution of the <a href="/design/summary/#edge3">previous
        design</a>. A similar color scheme was chosen to ensure that
    the new site felt similar to the previous site, but the new design is much cleaner than the previous version and
    appears more open and calm, thanks to extensive use of
    whitespace, particularly in the heading and menu.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>EdgeIRC is written on a simple PHP backend primarily to aid maintenance. Sections can be added, removed, and
    refactored by editing one menu file instead of having to change each
    page. This backend also allows the use of a MySQL server to store the news along with a form allowing admins to post
    news from their browser<sup><a href="#foot1" id="foot1body">[1]</a></sup>. Pages are set up as directories, so the
    underlying technology is not exposed to the user and can be changed at will without impacting links.
</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a href="#foot1body" id="foot1">[1]</a></sup> Unfortunately, I have not gotten access to the
    MySQL server on the current host yet, so the news system is a
    static page at the moment.</p>
