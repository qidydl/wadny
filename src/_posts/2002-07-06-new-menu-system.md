Not a whole lot going on. Been watching some racing with my dad… just finished the CART Chicago race from last week and some other stuff, but I haven’t been spending days out of the house like I was earlier in the week. However, I did get some more work done on the website today. You’ll notice that navigating through the about, band, gaming, and mirc sections works differently now—you get a subdirectory with a real name instead of the unintelligible `something?subsec=#` crap I had before. I didn’t actually get any real content into the gaming section, but I’ve got most of the navigation in place, which is the part most likely to give me problems. Content *should* be arriving sometime soon…
