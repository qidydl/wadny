You may have noticed some slight changes to the site.  :-D  I decided it was time to give edgeirc a facelift, and this is the result.  It requires a standards-compliant browser like Netscape 6.2 to work well, and the backgrounds might be a bit slow for modem users, but considering the level of traffic this site gets, I think it's worth it.  Enjoy.  :-)

Today we completed debugging our new advanced proxy detection services. Please appreciate the sense of security as now each and every user is scanned for insecure HTTP/SOCKS proxies upon connection. Users found with such proxies will be imposed a 30-minute network-wide ban.
<p>Please report any bugs to the opers in #edge

Well, it finally happened: egn died today.  However, we were there when it happened and sprang into action:  edgeirc now has two new servers (cutting and qid - although qid isn't technically "new") and a new version of services.  Khea isn't linked yet, but it will be on the 1st.  Are we fast or what?  :-D

Our main hub (egn.edgeirc.net) will be going down within the next week or so. At that time, we will be switching over to a temporary server until our new main box is ready for use. Please be tolerant of outages in the next little while as a result of this.

We will be upgrading our services soon to fix a number of obscure segfault problems that have appeared in the last week or so.Users should not see any difference once the new services are up. However, it is possible that some passwords may get corrupted in the upgrade process.If you have any problem, please contact your local friendly services oper.

Say hello to our first European server, oulu!  Located in Finland, this server should be faster for our friends on the other side of The Pond.  The servers and ircops sections have been updated with the new server.
<p>In other news, overthe has mysteriously gone down.  We're attempting to diagnose the problem.  In the meantime, overthe.edgeirc.net has been pointed to egn's ip, so you should be able to connect normally.

No sooner do I make an update than sonic reappears.  Unfortunately, I seem to have lost some of the info for it (including spydee's ICQ), but it's linked again and back in the server list.  Still not up to the total of 8 we had at one time, but doing better than recently.  As long as these servers remain stable, we should be able to easily handle our current load and (hopefully) attract some more attention.

Khea is working again, so the current server list is egn, overthe, edge, and khea.  If you haven't checked the <a href="http://stats.edgeirc.net" target="_new">stats page</a> in a while, have a look - the yearly graph is continually increasing.
<p>I've also just gone through the site and updated the information on all of the pages, so everything's correct now.  I also archived all of the news before 2001, so this page isn't quite so long now.

Overthe is back online, and edge appears to have solved whatever problems it was experiencing.  Khea has been down for a while but may be coming back soon.  Sonic is having unknown difficulties, we honestly don't know what's wrong there.  All the servers seem to have stabilized for now, however.

I'm back, but the only access I can get is a slow, unreliable cable modem connection.  The upload speed is 1/4 what I had on DSL, so even though the comp's been upgraded, I don't think I can run any servers fast enough to be useful.  If we do eventually get a better connection, I'll have qid back up immediately.

qid.edgeirc.net is having an extended downtime period. This was unexpected, but fortunately all other servers on the network have been performing exceptionally for the past few weeks.
<p>The hub has now also reached a point where splits are an unseen occurence. Congratulations to the Edge Gaming Network for a job well done!

As per tradition, it is now a known fact that QID likes to exagerate :)
<p>No, i'm not gone. I'm here, am I not? Anyhow, the hub is back up with correct DNS entries. Services are being worked on and should be availible within a day or so. The databases are safe and have been backed up daily up 'till now, so there should be no information loss once services are back online.
<p>As always, thanks for your continuing use of EdgeIRC!

Everything seems to have fucked up.  EGN won't run on the old ip, but egn.edgeirc.net isn't pointing to the new ip yet.  As a result, only one server is currently linked to egn.
<p>Also, services have somehow broken themselves and cannot be run anymore.  Recompiling doesn't appear to help.
<p>To make it even worse, I can no longer run ircd on my computer.  I might have a config problem, but I doubt it.  Recompiling doesn't help this either.
<p>Cyber_Ass has also disappeared off the face of the earth, so he can't help out or do anything.  At this rate, EdgeIRC might not be around for much longer...
