Well, I got this news script working correctly, so check in here every once in a while to get news. Don’t try to add or delete posts, it requires a password which you can’t get even with a copy of the script because it’s encrypted. Nyah.

The [desktop section]({% link about/author.md %}#desktop) was updated today with two new wallpapers and where you can get them. Some of those are really good, you should download them.
