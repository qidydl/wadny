<p>This page is intended as an entry point for companies or individuals interested in my professional/career work. I use
    my website for both personal and professional work, so a page explaining which parts are which is important. If you
    are a random person looking around, feel free to read whatever you want, however you want. If you are a possible
    employer, however, there are some things you must know.</p>
<p>First of all, this site contains content going back to the late 1990’s, and thus many things on this site no longer
    accurately reflect on me. The news archives, in particular, contain many posts from when I was still “just a kid” in
    high school, and obviously have no bearing on my current professional attitude. I hesitate to cite specifics, as
    this page would then undoubtedly become inaccurate as well.</p>
<p>Many of the sections on this site should not be used to judge my professional competence and attitude. The Band
    section has absolutely nothing to do with me—it is an homage to this website’s namesake, a band my father was in,
    and the history was written by another band member. The “Anselmo” section is similarly related. Humor, as the name
    implies, is simply collected jokes and other items that at some time I considered humorous, and quite obviously have
    nothing to do with any of my work.</p>
<p>So, what actually does reflect on me professionally? The <a href="/about/colophon/">about - colophon</a> page
    contains some useful information on contacting me and some of the technologies I have employed in creating this
    website. The <a href="/about/accessibility/">accessibility statement</a> also contains information on accessibility
    practices I have made use of. The <a href="/design/intro/">design</a> section contains an archive of past website
    designs I have done; most of them are rather poor compared to my current abilities, but they may still prove useful.
    The <a href="/programming/">programming</a> section contains some information on programs I have created; at the
    time of this writing, it is unfinished, but it may have since been updated. Lastly, the news section does contain
    some useful articles. There are a <a href="/news/during/2004/1/15/2138/"
        title="January 15, 2004: My 2¢ on Postel’s Law">couple</a> of <a href="/news/during/2004/1/29/1707/"
        title="January 29, 2004: How external links work">articles</a> in particular that provide useful technical
    information.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to remind any possible employers that a website is not an effective replacement for an
    in-person interview; if you have an interest in hiring me, please <a href="/professional/Resume.pdf">take a look at
        my résumé</a>, and/or contact me so we can communicate directly. Thank you.</p>
