<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>Maybe Unroyal still has some life left... I've been talking to a few people lately, including Jeremy from Airquake Levels on PQ, and there's a chance I'll be able to set Unroyal up on an SQL database!  This means adding new levels could be done entirely through a web-based form, so new designers could concentrate more on making a review than on making it look good in HTML.  However, I'll need reviewers that can put in some good effort - if you can help us out, PLEASE contact me - my e-mail is below.

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>I have come to a decision. No one has said anything, but it's obvious that the team is losing interest in the site and Unreal (except QID, of course!!). Therefore, I will soon be closing the site down.....well, not closing it down, but ceasing too update it let's say. I will do one more review - I really wanna play Apoclypse Threat, just released at <a href="http://www.unrealnation.net/cms">Crescent Moon Software</a>. After that, the site will either be updated by QID or not at all. There aren't many levels being released for us to review anymore, and people are starting to move on, more specifically to Half Life, including me. The review may not be for a few days, though, as I am about to get my comp upgraded, with a lovely new Voodoo 2 Banshee in it (which is a lot for me, seeing as I don't have a 3D card at the moment!).

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>Well, Psy uploaded his new level and managed to screw up both it and the deep space 666 review... PSY: STOP USING FRONTPAGE.  IT SUCKS.  IT SCREWS THINGS UP.  I fixed the reviews... he seems to have uploaded a few extras, we should have some more additions soon.

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>Oh dear. It has been a very long time since I last made an update. But no problems - after this QID and Combat-Seal will be handling the site for a while (I'm gonna stick around to review a couple more levels). Some technical problems have prevented us updating for quite some time, and now we seem to be back on track. New levels are... guess where? Yep, the <a href="latest.shtml">Latest Levels</a> section. The Unroyal team is gonna do some "featuring" pretty soon, so keep yer eyes peeled. Also, you may have noticed that I was one of the winners in the Cresent Moon Software's "Greetz" contest. <a href="http://www.unrealnation.com/cms">Check it out!</a>

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>Well, nothing's happened on the site... you may have noticed that we had some problems recently.  The entire redesign got deleted off planetunreal's server... fortunately I had it backed up on my HD.  Right now we need reviewers and HTML people to convert old reviews to the new format.  If you can help out in any way, contact me and I'll relay the information to the Unroyal team.  We're not dead yet, just in hibernation...
<p>*UPDATE 5:07PM EST* - I've just uploaded converted versions of the level packs.  You can view them in the older levels section.

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>Since my own website is finally hosted again, my days are rapidly running out of time, even during a vacation!  I guess I'll just have to get working and finish off all my homework (yes, I had homework over vacation - my teachers suck) so I can work on other stuff without the impending doom of 0's looming over my head.  Oh, you may have noticed that Unroyal 2.0 is now the main design of the site.  It's better than having that message about me deleting the old news file.  :-|  Psy did convert the levels packs though, so we'll still be converting all the old levels over.  Unfortunately, there haven't been many new levels... if you plan on making one, wait a bit for us to catch up please.  :-)  I guess that's all for now.

I recently received some stuff from Psy and other people working on the site, and all the new levels seem to be reviewed.  We should also have some more levels converted soon.  The Unroyal team has been revised, and there are some new and old people.  As soon as I've confirmed the list of people, I'll update the contacts page.  In the meantime, just hang with us.

<tr background="back.gif"><td><br>This is annoying...  I haven't received any e-mail from any of the people who are supposed to be converting levels, and psy has been quiet too.  I haven't noticed any new converted levels either.  I've been busy with getting sick, finishing math assignments, getting new versions of <a href="http://www.3d-unlimited.com/fpsid/ydl/idt/" target="idtwindow">my mIRC stuff</a> out, and fixing up <a href="http://www.3d-unlimited.com/fpsid/" target="fpsidwindow">my website.</a>  If nothing happens soon, I'll see if I can convert a few more levels.
