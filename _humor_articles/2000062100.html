<ul>
<li>"Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help but wonder:  What the hell was I thinking?"</li>
<li>"Congratulations on your wedding day! Too bad no one likes your wife."</li>
<li>"How could two people as beautiful as you both have such an ugly baby?"</li>
<li>"I've always wanted to have someone to hold, someone to love. After having met you, I've changed my mind."</li>
<li>"I must admit, you brought religion in my life. I never believed in hell 'til I met you."</li>
<li>"As the days go by, everyday I think of how lucky I am that you're not here to ruin it for me."</li>
<li>"If I get only one thing for Christmas, I hope it's your sister."</li>
<li>"As you grow older, Mum, I think of all the gifts you've given me. Like the need for therapy."</li>
<li>"Thanks for being a part of my life! I never knew what evil was before this!"</li>
<li>"Congratulations on your promotion.  Before you go, would you like to take this knife out of my back?  You'll probably need it again."</li>
<li>"Someday I hope to get married, but not to you."</li>
<li>"Happy Birthday!  You look great for your age... almost lifelike!"</li>
<li>"When we were together, you always said you'd die for me. Now that we've broken up, I think it's time to you kept your promise."</li>
<li>"I knew this day would come when you would leave me for my best friend. So here's his leash, water bowl and chew toys."</li>
<li>"We have been friends for a very long time, what say we call it quits."</li>
<li>"I'm so miserable without you, it's almost like you're here."</li>
<li>"Congratulations on your new bundle of joy. Did you ever find out who the father was?"</li>
<li>"Your friends and I wanted to do something special for your birthday... so we are having you put to sleep."</li>
