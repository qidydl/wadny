Khea is no longer suffering from the sporadic outages it had previously encountered for a week or so. Sorry for all the trouble that box seems to be bringing.

egn.edgeirc.net is now back up after a somewhat lengthy change of service providers.<p>Be assured that this change is all for the better when it comes to the stability of our hub server.

More server news: overthe is now gone for good - it just used more bandwidth and resources than the admin could handle.  EGN is also down temporarily while new hosting is being set up.  It should be back by monday.

We will be upgrading our services soon to fix a number of obscure segfault problems that have appeared in the last week or so.Users should not see any difference once the new services are up. However, it is possible that some passwords may get corrupted in the upgrade process.If you have any problem, please contact your local friendly services oper.

Say hello to our first European server, oulu!  Located in Finland, this server should be faster for our friends on the other side of The Pond.  The servers and ircops sections have been updated with the new server.<p>In other news, overthe has mysteriously gone down.  We're attempting to diagnose the problem.  In the meantime, overthe.edgeirc.net has been pointed to egn's ip, so you should be able to connect normally.

No sooner do I make an update than sonic reappears.  Unfortunately, I seem to have lost some of the info for it (including spydee's ICQ), but it's linked again and back in the server list.  Still not up to the total of 8 we had at one time, but doing better than recently.  As long as these servers remain stable, we should be able to easily handle our current load and (hopefully) attract some more attention.

Khea is working again, so the current server list is egn, overthe, edge, and khea.  If you haven't checked the <a href="http://stats.edgeirc.net" target="_blank">stats page</a> in a while, have a look - the yearly graph is continually increasing.
<p>I've also just gone through the site and updated the information on all of the pages, so everything's correct now.  I also archived all of the news before 2001, so this page isn't quite so long now.

Overthe is back online, and edge appears to have solved whatever problems it was experiencing.  Khea has been down for a while but may be coming back soon.  Sonic is having unknown difficulties, we honestly don't know what's wrong there.  All the servers seem to have stabilized for now, however.

egn.edgeirc.net had a high load condition earlier today and needed to be rebooted. My apologies for the downtime this caused.

The hub server had some massive difficulties in the past 2 days, but everything seems to be back to normal now.<br>

For a bit of fun, go check out the <a href="http://stats.edgeirc.net/">stats</a> and look at the huge spikes :)

I'm back, but the only access I can get is a slow, unreliable cable modem connection.  The upload speed is 1/4 what I had on DSL, so even though the comp's been upgraded, I don't think I can run any servers fast enough to be useful.  If we do eventually get a better connection, I'll have qid back up immediately.

My DSL is down for a while because PhoenixDSL, Telocity, and Verizon are all staffed by stupid fools.  I probably won't have any net access from home until at least the end of the month.  This is very not fun.

qid.edgeirc.net is having an extended downtime period. This was unexpected, but fortunately all other servers on the network have been performing exceptionally for the past few weeks.<br>
<br>
The hub has now also reached a point where splits are an unseen occurence. Congratulations to the Edge Gaming Network for a job well done!

Edge had a slight connection hicup (yes, the first one since the end of last summer). It is clearly visible on <a href="http://stats.edgeirc.net/">http://stats.edgeirc.net</a>.<br>

Heh, I just got demoralized that night... too much homework and stuff.  EGN should be fine, my server is back after some recompiling crap, all that's left is to wake up a couple other admins and get them relinked.

As promised, services are now back up (and upgraded) with data from the most recent daily backup.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your support during this move.

As per tradition, it is now a known fact that QID likes to exagerate :)<br>
<br>
No, i'm not gone. I'm here, am I not? Anyhow, the hub is back up with correct DNS entries. Services are being worked on and should be availible within a day or so. The databases are safe and have been backed up daily up 'till now, so there should be no information loss once services are back online.<br>
<br>
As always, thanks for your continuing use of EdgeIRC!

Everything seems to have fucked up.  EGN won't run on the old ip, but egn.edgeirc.net isn't pointing to the new ip yet.  As a result, only one server is currently linked to egn.

Also, services have somehow broken themselves and cannot be run anymore.  Recompiling doesn't appear to help.

To make it even worse, I can no longer run ircd on my computer.  I might have a config problem, but I doubt it.  Recompiling doesn't help this either.

Cyber_Ass has also disappeared off the face of the earth, so he can't help out or do anything.  At this rate, EdgeIRC might not be around for much longer...

We are in the process of moving to a new hub server from the same host.
The website has already been transferred and we're going to be moving the IRC server in a short while.<br>
<br>
Please stay tuned for updates.
