Added some more site stuff today. There’s a new humor article if you want some light reading, and I added FPSID (the major predecessor to this site) to the design section. I’ve also been cleaning up things here and there, moving stuff around, pruning code… general maintenance stuff. Just a reminder, you’re welcome to try and break my code, just let me know if you find anything, either with an email or a comment.
