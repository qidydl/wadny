title: Blogroll redux
---
Now that I’m doing the 8-to-5 life, I’ve taken to spending the first hour or so at work catching up on weblogs; this is somewhat justified, as a lot of the blogs I read will post technical articles, which applies directly to my job as a web designer (yes, I know I haven’t posted about the job yet; I’ll get around to it). As a result, I’ve picked up a few new sites and tired of a few old ones, so my blogroll has been updated. The new sites are:

- [And all that malarkey](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/ "Andy Clarke"){:rel='external'}
- [Asterisk](http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/ "D. Keith Robinson"){:rel='external'}
- [Authentic Boredom](http://www.cameronmoll.com/ "Cameron Moll"){:rel='external'}
- [Box of chocolates](http://boxofchocolates.ca/ "Derek Featherstone"){:rel='external'}
- [Decaffeinated](http://decaffeinated.org/ "Chris Clark"){:rel='external'}
- [Design dojo](http://www.designdojo.ca/ "Sam Royama"){:rel='external'}
- [Eris Free](http://www.erisfree.com/){:rel='external'}
- [Evhead](http://www.evhead.com/ "Evan Williams"){:rel='external'}
- [Jeff Croft](http://www.jeffcroft.com/){:rel='external'}
- [Justwatchthesky](http://justwatchthesky.com/ "Ryan Sims"){:rel='external'}
- [Mike Davidson](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/){:rel='external'}
- [Mike Rundle](http://phark.typepad.com/){:rel='external'}
- [OrderedList](http://www.orderedlist.com/){:rel='external'}
- [Shaun Inman](http://www.shauninman.com/){:rel='external'}
- [The Old New Thing](http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/ "Raymond Chen"){:rel='external'}
- [Waxy.org](http://waxy.org/ "Andy Baio"){:rel='external'}
- and [What Do I Know](http://www.whatdoiknow.org/ "Todd Dominey"){:rel='external'}

I also dropped a few sites that weren’t updating very often to make room for this big influx. I may have to cut out a couple of sites to keep the list manageable, but we’ll see how this works.
