Several weblogs seem to have suddenly disappeared. [Eris Free](http://www.erisfree.com/){:rel='external'}, [Jeff Croft](http://www.jeffcroft.com/){:rel='external'}, and [Make Believe](http://www.make-believe.org/){:rel='external'} are all gone—Eris and Make Believe appear to have been suspended, and Jeff’s site simply doesn’t load. One site at once is an accident, two sites at once is a coincidence, but three sites? All, as far as I can tell, hosted completely independently? This is a little unusual. Does anyone know Eris, Jeff, or <del>um, the guy that runs make-believe (sorry, I can’t remember his name)</del><ins>Joseph</ins> and know what’s going on? If they need new hosting, I would recommend [R1Hosting](http://www.r1hosting.com/){:rel='external'}, because I know the guy who runs it and I know that he knows what he’s doing. Hopefully this is just a temporary problem, and it will get resolved soon.

<ins datetime="2004-07-22T20:43:00-05:00">Update at 8:43pm: Make-Believe is back now as well. It is, of course, written by Joseph Pearson, which I could have known by looking at *my own blogroll*. Oops. Sorry, Joseph.</ins>
