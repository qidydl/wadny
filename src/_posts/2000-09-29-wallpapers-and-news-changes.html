title: Wallpapers and news changes
---
<p>I don’t know if I’ve been mentioning this every time, but I’ve been throwing up various new wallpapers in the <a
        href="/about/desktop/">desktop+wallpaper</a> section. I might be going through them at some point and weeding
    out ones that aren’t quite as good anymore.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice a few changes in the news page, mainly an ‘edit’ button at the bottom. I did some screwing around
    with the news script and made it a little better, and also added the option for me to edit existing posts. I’m
    considering making a release of this, but it’s pretty complex…</p>
<p>I also added a few new random titles and removed a couple old ones, so keep your eye out for those.</p>
<p><abbr title="By The Way">BTW</abbr>, from now on, multiple posts in one day will probably be edited together like
    this, instead of posted separately.</p>
