title: Changed the comments page
---
Well, I’ve gone and made some more changes to the news system. The little popup comments box is gone; the comments links now open a page with just the one news post, the existing comments, and the form to post more. This is pretty much the standard way most weblogs work and should be nicer to use than the old system. I’ve still got to write the code to delete a post, add categories and titles to posts, add TrackBack info to the news pages and the RSS feed, switch the RSS feed to use full posts instead of excerpts, write (or find) a simple PHP-based TrackBack server implementation, look over and fix the aural and print stylesheets, and add some other content that’s been laying around. Plus I’ve got to make my schedule for next quarter, finish two lab reports, and do a bunch of homework and reading.

SERENITY NOW!
