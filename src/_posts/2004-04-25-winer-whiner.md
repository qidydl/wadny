I [mentioned before]({% post_url 2004-03-18-now-with-indivisible-pieces %} "Now with indivisible pieces (March 18)") that <q cite="{% post_url 2004-03-18-now-with-indivisible-pieces %}">Dave [Winer] is kind of an arrogant jerk</q>, and [Tomas Jogin has found more evidence](http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/04/23/back_on_crack "jogin.com: Back on crack"){:rel='external'}. Mr. Winer, seriously: give it a rest. If RSS is so superior and so widely used, then why are you so scared of Atom? And why are you so eager to monopolize on one syndication format? Different formats may suit different applications, and trying to force a square application into a round format isn’t going to work any better than pegs and holes. And what if Atom is better? If people don’t want to use RSS, trying to force it down their throats won’t change anything. Let the people decide what they want. If they choose Atom, then so be it.
